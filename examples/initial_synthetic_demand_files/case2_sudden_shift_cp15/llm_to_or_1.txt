Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The critical stock-out risk is high as on-hand inventory starts at 0. Historical demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] show an average of 111.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Given the target service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80, the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will use 'default' methods for the first period to establish a baseline using all 5 historical samples provided, as no seasonal context or changepoints are yet observable in-game.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we are making a decision for the second time. At the start of Period 2, we see Period 1 concluded with a demand of 108 units. Our initial order of 141 units (placed in Period 1) is currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 108 units of lost sales from Period 1. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (including the newly observed P1 demand) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108], yielding a mean of 110.8 and a standard deviation of 15.3. Since there is no evidence of a demand shift or lead time deviation yet, I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 2) and demand parameters based on all available history. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+2)*110.8 = 332.4 and sigma_hat as sqrt(3)*15.3 = 26.5.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 67 units with 137 units in-transit. From the Period 2 conclude message, the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 2, indicating an actual lead time of 1 period, which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 pre-game periods was [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean ~111.4). Game demand so far is 108 (P1) and 74 (P2), suggesting a slight downward trend or variance. Since the actual lead time observed is 1, I will set L to 1 using the 'explicit' method to override the promised lead time of 2. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (all available data points including historical) to capture the current demand level, which helps the OR backend calculate the base stock for a (1+L) period horizon. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we are facing a stockout (on-hand = 0) after Period 3 demand exceeded supply. Analyzing lead times: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 2 (L=1), but the Period 2 order (137 units) failed to arrive in Period 3. Since the promised lead time is 2, the Period 2 order is expected to arrive in Period 4. Therefore, actual lead time appears closer to the promised 2 periods rather than the shortened 1 period seen initially. Demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119] shows relative stability without clear seasonal shifts. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the most recent context including the game history) to capture the current mean of ~100 units/period. L is set to 'default' (2) to align with the promised time and the observed delay of the P2 order. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (L+1), which is appropriate given the current stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $483.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time for 'chips(Regular)' has fluctuated: the order from Period 1 arrived in 1 period, while the order from Period 2 arrived in 2 periods (as promised). The order from Period 3 (32 units) is still in transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 (after this decision phase). Current on-hand inventory is low (13 units). Historical demand over the last 5 periods [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (including pre-game and actuals) shows a mean of approximately 111.4 units. I will use the promised lead time (L=2) as the baseline since it was most recently observed. I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current demand regime, ensuring the base stock level (covering L+1=3 periods) is sufficient to recover from the stockout in Period 3 and meet the incoming demand while balancing the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product is 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51]. Mean demand is approximately 103.3. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 309 in-transit. Lead time history: Period 1 arrived in 1 period; Period 2 arrived in 2 periods. Orders from Period 3 (32 units) and Period 5 (138 units) are currently in-transit. The Period 3 order is now 3 periods old (one period past the promised lead time of 2), which is concerning but not yet definitive of a lost shipment. I will maintain the promised lead time of 2 for L. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent volatility (avg 95.2) and set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to account for the variance in the most recent demand samples, ensuring the OR backend targets a sufficient base stock to recover from the current stockout.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we face a stockout situation with 0 units on-hand. Looking at historical arrivals: Order 1 (P1) arrived in 1 period (P2); Order 2 (P2) arrived in 2 periods (P4); Order 3 (P3, 32 units) is now 2 periods past its promised delivery and has likely been lost as it didn't arrive in P5 or P6. Order 4 (P4, 139 units) and Order 5 (P5, 138 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the history, actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 2. I will use the default promised lead time (L=2) but adjust demand estimates. Demand has been volatile but shows a slight downward trend in the last two periods (51, 67) compared to earlier (108, 74, 119, 124). I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture recent levels while smoothing out the volatility, and explicit sigma to handle the high variation (std is approx 30). This allows the OR engine to set a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 3 (32 units) is likely lost; Actual lead time varies between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 58 units on hand and 171 units in transit (likely the order from Period 4, which is currently at lead time 4 and may be lost, plus the order from Period 1). History shows lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (P1=1, P2=2, P5=2, P6=1). The order from P3 (32 units) is definitely lost. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility but remains around a mean of ~100. Based on the 7 periods of data [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103], the mean is 92.2 and std is ~26. I will use 'default' for L (promised 2) as the average is currently 1.5. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the full recent distribution of demand while ignoring the pre-game 'Past demands' which are slightly higher, to avoid over-ordering given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4).

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed (range 1-2 periods); Shipment from Period 3 (32 units) confirmed lost.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the system is stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows high demand volatility (ranging from 51 to 124) and unstable lead times (varying between 1 and 2 periods). Crucially, the order for 32 units from Period 3 is confirmed lost as it is now 6 periods past placement. Current in-transit inventory is 260 units (comprising 139 from P4, 32 from P3 [lost], 0 from P7, and 89 from P8). After adjusting for the lost P3 shipment, the pipeline is 228 units. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) averages 87.4. To recover from the current stock-out and account for the 2-period lead time (needing to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand), mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent high volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed lead times (1, 2, 2, 1).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 9 periods is [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100], with a mean of ~93. Our on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 260 units in transit (139 from P4, 32 from P3 (likely lost), 89 from P8, and 0 from P7/P9). Specifically, the order from P4 (139 units) is now 6 periods old and far exceeds the observed lead time of 1-2 periods; it is almost certainly lost. The order from P3 (32 units) was previously flagged as lost. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is likely only 89 units (from P8). Demand has been relatively stable around 90-110 units recently. I will set L to 2 (promised) as observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand stability (~90 units), and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility. Given the loss of the P4 and P3 shipments, the OR backend's inventory calculation (which includes all in-transit) will be overestimated. By setting L to 2 and using recent demand, I aim to trigger a restock that compensates for the 'ghost' units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 4 (139 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed vs 2-period promised lead time).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the inventory situation for 'chips(Regular)' is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced significant losses (Period 3 and Period 4 orders). The pipeline inventory currently consists of orders from Period 8 (89 units) and Period 10 (46 units). Given the history, actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods, but the recent absence of arrivals suggests either longer transit times or further losses. Demand has been relatively stable with a mean around 90-100 units. To recover from the stockouts and account for the high loss rate, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand level. I will use 'explicit' for L, setting it to 2 to align with the promised lead time while acknowledging the risk of delay. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to ensure the OR engine calculates a sufficient safety stock to handle the observed demand volatility (std \u2248 25-30). This approach aims to restore a healthy inventory position while the backend factors in the current 135 units in transit.

Historical analysis shows lead times are unstable, varying between 1 and 2 periods (P1: 1, P2: 2, P5: 2, P6: 1, P10: 1). Orders from P3 and P4 are confirmed lost. The recent demand (last 5 periods) has a mean of 99.2 (92, 100, 79, 122, and P12 estimate). I will use L=2 (explicit) to be conservative given the volatility and the risk of lost shipments. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current demand regime (~100 units/period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. The pipeline of 264 units is high, but given the frequency of lost orders (P3 and P4), the OR backend needs these parameters to maintain a sufficient base stock to cover the (L+1) window.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU chips(Regular) has 0 on-hand inventory and 321 units in-transit. Based on the history, actual lead times oscillate between 1 and 2 periods (P1:1, P2:2, P5:2, P6:1, P10:1). Critically, two orders are confirmed lost: Period 3 (32 units) and Period 4 (139 units), as they are significantly past the 2-period promised lead time. This results in a persistent stockout situation (ending on-hand 0 for 5 of the last 6 periods). Demand remains relatively stable, with the most recent 5 samples (P8-P12) being [92, 100, 79, 122, 119], averaging 102.4 units. Since orders are frequently lost, the 'in-transit' figure is inflated by units that will never arrive. I will set the lead time to an explicit '2' to reflect the promised window despite the volatility. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level (~102 units/period) while ensuring the OR backend's capped policy accounts for the high risk of stockouts and lost shipments.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the on-hand inventory is 0. History shows that shipments from Period 3 (32 units) and Period 4 (139 units) are confirmed lost, as they are well beyond the promised 2-period lead time. Shipments from Period 8 (89 units), Period 11 (4 units), Period 12 (57 units), and Period 13 (13 units) are currently in-transit. The in-transit total of 334 units likely includes the 171 lost units (32+139), meaning the 'true' pipeline inventory is only 163 units. Observed lead times have been 1, 2, 2, 1, and 1. While the average is 1.4, I will use 'default' (promised L=2) to maintain a conservative buffer given the frequency of lost orders and stockouts. Demand appears stable around a mean of 96.5 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand trends (Mean ~96) while filtering out the initial noise, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock covering (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~98 units/period). However, shipping reliability is poor. Orders from Period 3 (32 units), Period 4 (139 units), and Period 8 (89 units) are now confirmed or highly likely lost, as they are 7+ periods overdue relative to the 2-period promised lead time. The 260 units currently in transit likely reflect these ghost orders. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated 'pipeline inventory', I am using 'explicit' L and mu_hat. I set L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat to 400. This value is roughly (1+L) * mean_demand (3 * 98 = 294) plus a buffer (approx. 100 units) to force an order that compensates for the pipeline units that will likely never arrive. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture recent demand volatility while smoothing outliers.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 8 (89 units) is likely lost (7 periods elapsed vs 2-period promised lead time). Actual lead times for successful deliveries fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we are facing significant supply chain instability. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 100 units (avg of last 15 periods is ~95, recent 5 is ~116). However, the primary issue is delivery reliability. Shipments from Period 3 (32 units), Period 4 (139 units), and Period 8 (89 units) are considered lost, totaling 260 units. The current 'In-transit' of 434 includes these 260 lost units plus the Period 15 order (174 units). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 174 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (434) from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these losses. I set mu_hat to 634 units to account for (L+1) demand (approx 300 units) plus the 260 'phantom' units in the pipeline. I use an 'explicit' L of 3 to reflect the higher observed lead times (max 3), and an 'explicit' sigma_hat of 60 to handle the high demand variance and supply risk.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss confirmed: Period 3, 4, and 8 orders (total 260 units) are permanently missing from effective pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $676.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant increase, with the most recent demand (P16) reaching 170 units compared to the historical average of approximately 100-110 units. Combined with the pre-game history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the mean demand appears to be shifting upward. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this upward trend while maintaining stability. The effective pipeline inventory is heavily compromised: out of 468 units in-transit, 260 units (from P3, P4, and P8) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. The OR engine is unaware of these losses and will underestimate the required order size if not corrected. Since I cannot directly subtract lost units from the pipeline in the OR backend, I will use an 'explicit' lead time L=4. By increasing L from the promised 2 to 4, I force the base-stock calculation (which uses (1+L) * demand) to target a higher inventory level, compensating for the 'phantom' units in-transit that will never arrive. This ensures we maintain a sufficient service level despite the unreliable logistics and rising demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Period 16 demand (170) is significantly higher than previous 15-period average (approx 103). Monitoring for sustained peak.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was 213, confirming the upward shift noted in Period 16 (170). The average demand over the last two periods is 191.5, significantly higher than the previous average of ~103. This suggests a new demand regime. On-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit is 638, but this includes confirmed lost orders from Periods 3, 4, and 8 (32 + 139 + 89 = 260 units). Effective pipeline inventory is actually 378 (638 - 260). Actual lead times have stabilized recently around 1-2 periods (Period 15 arrived in 1, Period 16 ordered 208 and is expected soon). To account for the higher demand and the lost stock, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current spike (Period 17: 213, Period 16: 170, Period 15: 112), and setting L to 2 to remain conservative given the history of delivery volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-17 demand average is 191.5, a ~85% increase over the previous 15-period average. Maintain exclusion of 260 units of lost stock (P3, P4, P8) when assessing pipeline health.

Daily Reward (R_t): $660.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe a confirmed demand regime shift. Demands for Periods 16, 17, and 18 were 170, 213, and 166 respectively (mean ~183), which is significantly higher than the pre-Period 16 average of ~103. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new mean for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Regarding inventory, we have 4 units on-hand and 468 units in-transit. However, historical evidence (Carry-over Insights) confirms that orders from Periods 3 (32 units), 4 (139 units), and 8 (89 units) are lost, totaling 260 phantom units in the pipeline. The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will over-count these lost units, leading to under-ordering. To compensate, I will use an 'explicit' L of 5. By increasing L from the promised 2 to 5, the backend increases the 'base_stock' calculation (which is proportional to 1+L), effectively offsetting the 260-unit hole in the pipeline while accounting for the higher demand regime and providing a buffer against recent lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are managing chips(Regular). The demand has clearly shifted into a higher regime starting at Period 16. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is 195 units, compared to the initial average of ~103 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 694 units. However, as documented in Carry-over Insights, orders from P3 (32), P4 (139), and P8 (89) totaling 260 units are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from P16 (208 units) is now 4 periods old (placed in P16, promised L=2, now P20 start), suggesting it may also be lost or severely delayed. If we subtract the confirmed lost 260 units and the likely lost 208 units (total 468) from the 694 in-transit, the effective pipeline is only 226 units (the P19 order). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the new high-demand regime while accounting for the ~468 units of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline, I will set L to 3 (reflecting recent delivery volatility) and use an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: High-regime average is 195. With L=3, mu_hat = (1+3) * 195 = 780. To offset the 468 lost/missing units that the OR engine still 'sees' in the pipeline, I will increase mu_hat by that amount: 780 + 468 = 1248. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher volatility of the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Shipment from Period 16 (208 units) is likely lost (4 periods elapsed vs 2-period promised lead time), increasing total likely lost stock to 468 units (P3, P4, P8, P16). Demand remains high, averaging 195 over last 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has clearly shifted to a higher regime starting at Period 16. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 195.6, compared to the initial baseline of ~103. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this sustained shift. Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a significant rate of lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P3 (32), P4 (139), P8 (89), and now P16 (208) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 468 units. While 'In-transit' shows 1059 units, only 591 units (P19=226, P20=365) are viable. To protect against the stockout risk seen in P20 (on-hand 0, arrivals 0), I will use an explicit L=3 to ensure the backend accounts for the observed upper bound of delivery times and the ongoing uncertainty, while mu_hat and sigma_hat target the recent high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-20 average is 195.6 (+90% vs baseline). Shipment loss tracker: P3, P4, P8, and P16 orders (total 468 units) are considered lost and must be excluded from effective pipeline inventory calculations.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 22, On-hand=0, In-transit=1059. A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 16; demand has averaged 195.17 over the last 6 periods (Periods 16-21), compared to the prior baseline of 103. The Carry-over Insights identify 468 units as 'permanently lost' (P3, P4, P8, P16 orders). The effective pipeline is therefore 1059 - 468 = 591 units. Lead times for successful deliveries vary between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 1.7. Setting L to the promised 2 is safer given the systemic losses. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the new demand mean (~195) and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand and accounts for the high service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we are evaluating the demand for 'chips(Regular)'. Since Period 16, demand has significantly shifted from a historical mean of ~103 to a new regime mean of ~195 (observed demands: 170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176). The average of the last 7 periods is 192.4. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture this higher demand level. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=7) to reflect the increased volatility of this new regime. Regarding lead time, we have observed a range from 1 to 3 periods (Average ~1.8). Setting L to 'calculate' allows the OR engine to use the historical average of successful arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 415 units. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) of 468 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 3, 4, 8, and 16, which are confirmed or highly likely to be lost based on elapsed time vs. the 2-period promise. Because the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock, and these 468 units will never arrive, I must adjust the OR parameters. However, the OR backend's capped policy and fixed logic mean I cannot manually 'zero out' the pipeline. By setting a robust mu_hat based on the last 7 periods, I ensure the target stock reflects the current high-demand state, while the on-hand inventory provides a temporary buffer.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 24. A significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 16, with demand increasing from a baseline of ~103 to an average of ~198.8 over the last 8 periods (P16-P23: 170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176, 243). The inventory status shows On-hand = 172 and In-transit = 468. However, based on the carry-over insights, the 468 units in-transit are comprised of lost orders (P3, P4, P8, P16), meaning the 'effective' pipeline is 0. With lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2), we must set parameters to cover demand during the risk period (L+1). I will use N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime. Setting L to 'explicit' value of 2 ensures the base-stock calculation reflects the promised/typical lead time, while mu_hat using the recent average will prompt the backend to place orders to replenish the empty effective pipeline and cover upcoming high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains high: Period 16-23 average is 198.8 units (+93% vs baseline). Effective pipeline inventory is 0; the 468 units shown as In-transit are confirmed lost shipments (P3, P4, P8, P16).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the demand regime shift is firmly established. Since Period 16, demand has averaged approximately 198.3 units per period, compared to the initial baseline of ~103. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 468 units corresponds exactly to orders from Periods 3 (32), 4 (139), 8 (89), and 16 (208), which are now confirmed lost given the elapsed time (4+ periods for the most recent). Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. To protect against stockouts in this high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 periods (P16-P24) to capture the ~200 unit/period average. I will set sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the average of successfully delivered shipments (ranging from 1-3 periods).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is 198.0 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~103 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total in-transit quantity is 559 units, but 468 units are from orders placed in Periods 3, 4, 8, and 16 which are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (significantly exceeding the promised 2-period lead time). This leaves only the Period 25 order (91 units) as effective pipeline inventory. To maintain a service level of 80% (q = 4/(4+1)) and cover the high-demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current mean and standard deviation. I am keeping L at the default (promised 2 periods) as recent successful deliveries (P19, P20) arrived within 2-3 periods, but I am setting an explicit mu_hat to ensure we cover (L+1) = 3 periods of the new 198-unit demand average, aiming for a base stock around 600-700 units to replenish the depleted on-hand stock and account for lost shipments.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 26 is approximately 194.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The total in-transit quantity is 629 units, which includes 468 units from confirmed/likely lost shipments (P3, P4, P8, P16) and 161 units from recent orders (P25: 91 units, P26: 70 units). Since the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline inventory (629) from the calculated base stock, and the backend has no awareness of lost shipments, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these lost units. Target base stock = (L+1) * 194.5 + Safety Stock. With L=2, (1+2)*194.5 = 583.5. To account for the 468 units the backend will 'ghost' subtract, I set mu_hat to 583.5 + 468 = 1051.5. This ensures the backend places an order that considers the actual effective pipeline (161) rather than the inflated in-transit figure (629). Sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent volatility in the high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent inventory stockout due to systemic shipment loss (468 units) and sustained high demand (avg ~194.5 since P16). Effective pipeline is only 161 units (P25, P26).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the demand regime for chips(Regular) remains high, averaging 194.5 units since Period 16. Total in-transit inventory is 1008 units, but 468 units (from Periods 3, 4, 8, and 16) are confirmed or highly likely lost, meaning the effective pipeline is 540 units (from Periods 25, 26, 27). On-hand inventory is 0. The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will use the 1008 in-transit value, under-ordering because it believes 468 units are coming that are actually lost. To compensate for this 468-unit 'phantom' inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. My forecast for the next 3 periods (L+1) is 195 units/period * 3 = 585 units. To offset the 468 lost units, I add them to this forecast: 585 + 468 = 1053. This forces the OR engine to place an order that covers the actual demand needs plus the gap left by missing stock. Lead time (L) is kept at the promised 2, and sigma_hat is calculated over the recent high-demand regime (N=12) to ensure a high service level during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total confirmed/likely lost stock remains 468 units (P3:32, P4:139, P8:89, P16:208). Mu_hat is being explicitly inflated to compensate for the OR backend's inclusion of these lost units in pipeline inventory calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $525.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the on-hand inventory is 327. The systemic issue remains the 'In-transit' figure of 549 units, which includes 468 units from confirmed lost shipments (Periods 3, 4, 8, and 16). The OR backend calculates orders based on 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the backend incorrectly counts these 468 lost units as available pipeline, it will under-order unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to offset this phantom inventory. 

Demand Context: Since Period 16, demand has shifted to a higher regime, averaging approximately 196 units per period (13 periods of data: 170 to 213). 

Target Calculation:
Desired Base Stock for (L+1) periods = 196 * 3 = 588 units (plus a safety buffer). 
Effective Pipeline = 81 (from Period 28). 
Required Order = Desired Base Stock - (On-hand + Effective Pipeline) = 588 - (327 + 81) = 180 units.
To force the backend to order ~180 units despite it seeing 549 in transit, we need to set mu_hat such that: mu_hat - (On-hand + In-transit) \u2248 180.
mu_hat \u2248 180 + 327 + 549 = 1056.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 30. Demand context: Demand remains in a high regime starting at Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to 29 is approximately 198.7 units. Most recent demand (P29) was 215. Inventory context: On-hand is 112. In-transit is 764. However, 468 units are confirmed/highly likely lost (P3, P4, P8, P16), leaving an effective pipeline of 296 units (P28 order of 81, P29 order of 215). Parameter selection: 1) Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P25-P27) occurred within 1-3 periods. 2) mu_hat must account for (L+1)=3 periods of high-regime demand (approx 198.7 * 3 = 596). However, the OR backend sees 764 units in-transit. To force an order that covers the gap created by the 468 lost units, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Effective base stock needed = (Target for 3 periods) + (Lost units). Target for 3 periods at ~200/period is 600. Plus 468 lost units = 1068. Current on-hand (112) + pipeline (764) = 876. To trigger an order, base_stock must exceed 876. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1068 and sigma_hat using recent_N=14 to reflect the current high-demand volatility.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 31. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shifted from a baseline of ~103 to ~200 starting around Period 16. The average demand over the last 15 periods (P16-P30) is 201.2 units. We are currently stocked out. Inventory Reconciliation: Reported In-transit is 990 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders from P3 (32), P4 (139), P8 (89), and P16 (208) are confirmed lost, totaling 468 units. These units will never arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from the order calculation (pipeline inventory). Actual effective pipeline consists of orders from P28 (81), P29 (215), and P30 (226), totaling 522 units. Strategy: To ensure the OR backend orders enough despite the 468 phantom units in the pipeline, I will set L to 'explicit' 2 (promised) to stabilize the base stock calculation, and use 'explicit' for mu_hat. The target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand is approximately 201 * 3 = 603 units plus a safety buffer. However, because the backend subtracts 990 (522 real + 468 lost) from the base stock, I must inflate mu_hat so that (Base Stock - 990) results in a meaningful order. To maintain a flow of ~200 units/period, I need to offset the 468 units. Targeting a base stock of ~1100 to yield a net order of ~110. I will set mu_hat to 1100 to cover the pipeline gap and demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Stockout persists. Effective pipeline is 522 units (P28, P29, P30); the remaining 468 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P3, P4, P8, P16). Recent 15-period demand average (P16-P30) is 201.2 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 32. On-hand inventory is 20 units. In-transit is 837 units, but 468 units (from Periods 3, 4, 8, and 16) are confirmed/likely lost based on the 'Carry-over Insights'. This leaves an effective pipeline of 369 units (Orders from P30: 226 units and P31: 143 units). The lead time for successful deliveries remains volatile, averaging 2.1 periods but ranging from 1 to 3. Demand has shifted significantly upward since Period 16; the average demand for the last 15 periods (P16-P30) is 201.2 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P29-P31) show even higher volatility (avg 235). To prevent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of the high-demand regime (~200 units/period). However, the OR backend includes the 468 lost units in its pipeline calculation (In-transit: 837), which would lead it to under-order. To counteract this, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, calculating the desired base stock (Target Inventory) and adding the lost 468 units to it. Target Inventory = (L+1) * 201 = (2+1) * 201 = 603. Adjusted mu_hat = 603 + 468 = 1071. This forces the backend to place an order that treats the lost units as non-existent.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains significantly higher than the initial baseline, with a 15-period average (P16-P30) of 201.2 and recent demand (P31-P32) averaging 231. The effective pipeline inventory calculation must exclude 468 units that are confirmed or highly likely lost (P3, P4, P8, P16). The OR backend calculates orders based on 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Since the backend incorrectly includes those 468 lost units in the pipeline, I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat' to offset this. Calculation: Effective L is approx 2. Mean demand (mu) is ~210. Desired base_stock for (L+1)=3 periods is ~630. However, to bypass the 468-unit 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to a value that ensures a positive order. Given In-transit is 866 and 468 are lost, actual In-transit is 398. To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover a 3-period window (approx 630 units) while it thinks the pipeline is 866, I provide an explicit mu_hat of 1100. This ensures the backend (min(base_stock - 866, cap)) results in an order that maintains service levels despite systemic shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed total lost stock is 468 units (Orders from P3, P4, P8, P16). These units remain in the 'In-transit' figure indefinitely. Parameters are being adjusted to compensate for the OR backend's overestimation of available pipeline inventory.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with the average demand over the last 18 periods (P16-P33) being approximately 201 units. Period 33 demand was 182 units. Current On-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' shown is 1080 units, but 468 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (Orders from P3, P4, P8, P16) that never arrived. The effective pipeline inventory consists of the orders from P31 (143), P32 (255), and P33 (214), totaling 612 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1080 units from the base stock calculation, it will severely under-order if I use standard methods. To compensate, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I estimate the required base stock to cover L+1 periods (where L=2) at approximately 3 periods * 201 units = 603 units + a safety stock buffer. I will set mu_hat explicitly high enough to trigger an order that fills the gap created by the 468 phantom units in the backend's pipeline view. An explicit mu_hat of 1075 (covering expected 3-period demand of ~600 + the 468 lost units) is intended to force the backend to place an order sufficient to maintain stock levels.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains sustained and significantly higher than the initial baseline, with a 19-period average (P16-P34) of approximately 201 units. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has slightly moderated to ~180. I will use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while filtering out the very early low-demand data. A significant issue remains: 468 units (from orders in P3, P4, P8, P16) are confirmed or highly likely lost, yet they stay in the OR backend's 'In-transit' calculation. This causes the backend to under-order. To force the backend to place necessary orders, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat. The calculation is: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Expected Demand + Lost Units Adjustment. With L=2 (promised), L+1=3. Expected demand is ~200. Target Base Stock \u2248 (3 * 200) + 468 = 1068. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that achieves this target stock level to compensate for the phantom inventory.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at a high level (average ~199 units). Current inventory is 33 units on-hand with 854 units in-transit. However, 468 of those in-transit units are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 3, 4, 8, and 16. The backend OR engine incorrectly counts these 468 units as available pipeline inventory. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover demand, I must inflate mu_hat. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 386 units (854 - 468). Recent lead times have been 3 periods (P31, P32). I will set L=3. To compensate for the 468 missing units, I use 'explicit' mu_hat. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + z * sigma. With L=3, mean=200, z=1.28 (for 80% service level), and sigma~35: base_stock = 4 * 200 + 1.28 * 70 \u2248 890. The OR backend orders: Order = base_stock - (In-transit). To get the backend to target 890 while it sees 854 in-transit, I need to provide a mu_hat that results in a base stock of roughly 890 + 468 = 1358. 1358 / (1+L) = 339.5. I will set mu_hat to 1358.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss remains at 468 units (P3, P4, P8, P16). Recent lead times (P31, P32) are consistent at 3 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 37. Demand remains in a high regime (avg ~200 units/period since P16). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). Pipeline Analysis: Total In-transit is 1173. This includes 468 units confirmed lost (P3:32, P4:139, P8:89, P16:208) which the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive. Effective pipeline consists of orders from P33 (214), P35 (105), and P36 (386), totaling 705 units. Lead times have stabilized at approximately 2-3 periods (Recent arrivals: P34 @ 3 periods, P35 @ 3 periods, P36 @ 2 periods). Parameter Selection: L is set to 3 periods (recent average). To counteract the OR backend's inclusion of 468 phantom units in its 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Desired base stock = (L+1) * Forecasted Demand = 4 * 200 = 800 units. To get the OR engine to order sufficiently while it thinks it already has 468 units, I set mu_hat = 800 + 468 = 1268. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility (N=20) to maintain a high service level during this stockout recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss total remains 468 units (P3, P4, P8, P16). These units inflate 'In-transit' figures and require mu_hat compensation. Lead times for successful deliveries currently average 2.5-3 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a significant 'In-transit' figure of 1315 units. However, based on the history recorded in Carry-Over Insights, 468 units (from orders in Periods 3, 4, 8, and 16) are confirmed/likely lost. The OR backend is unaware of these losses and includes them in its pipeline inventory calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), which leads to under-ordering. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Demand has been in a high-demand regime since Period 16, averaging ~203 units over the last 22 periods. Calculating the required base stock: A 3-period lead time (L=2 promised, but often 3 actual) requires covering 4 periods of demand (L+1). At ~203 units/period, base stock should be ~812 plus safety stock. However, since the backend subtracts the full 1315 (including the 468 lost units), I must inflate mu_hat. To ensure an order of roughly 250-300 units is placed to keep up with demand, I set mu_hat to 1300. This offset helps the backend reach a target stock level that accounts for the 'phantom' inventory it believes exists.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is sustained at a high level (mean \u2248 203 over the last 23 periods). The primary challenge is systemic shipment loss: orders from P3, P4, P8, and P16 (totaling 468 units) are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. As of Period 39, In-transit is 1341. Subtracting the 468 lost units yields an effective pipeline of 873 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock (approx 840 units for L=3) and then add the 468 units of lost stock to it, setting mu_hat to 1308. This ensures the backend's calculation (base_stock - 1341) results in an order that maintains necessary stock levels. Lead times for successful deliveries have stabilized around 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss remains constant at 468 units (P3, P4, P8, P16). Effective pipeline inventory must always be calculated as (In-transit - 468). Lead times for successful deliveries are averaging 3 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, on-hand inventory is 383 and the reported in-transit is 801 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 468 of these in-transit units (from P3, P4, P8, P16) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 333 units (801 - 468), consisting of orders from P39 (14 units) and P31-P35 (the rest). Demand since Period 16 has stabilized into a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 198 units per period (P16-P39 mean is ~198.5). Successful lead times currently fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with a recent average of 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite 'seeing' the ghost inventory of 468 units, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target base stock. Target stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=3 and mean=199, base stock should be ~796 + safety. However, the OR backend subtracts the full 801 'in-transit' units. To force an order that covers the gap created by the 468 lost units, I set mu_hat explicitly high: (4 periods * 199 demand) + 468 lost units compensation = 1264. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=24, since the regime shift at P16) to capture current volatility.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows On-hand: 174 and In-transit: 912. However, based on extensive history, 468 units from orders in Periods 3, 4, 8, and 16 are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (912) from the calculated base stock, which would result in massive under-ordering. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The effective pipeline is actually 444 units (912 - 468). Recent demand (P16-P40) is stable at an average of 200.2 units. Lead times for successful deliveries currently vary between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2. Lead time (L) is set to 2. The explicit mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units = (3 * 200) + 468 = 1068. This ensures the OR engine places an order that accounts for the phantom stock it believes exists.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with the most recent 5-period average (P37-P41) being 197.2 units. A significant systemic issue persists: 468 units (from orders P3, P4, P8, P16) are 'In-transit' but confirmed lost. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering (since it believes those 468 units are coming), I must inflate mu_hat. Current status: On-hand is 73. Total In-transit is 813. Effective In-transit is (813 - 468) = 345. Successful lead times recently ranged from 1 to 3 periods, averaging 2 periods. To cover 3 periods (L+1) at ~200 units/period, we need ~600 units in the pipeline. With 73 on-hand and 345 effective in-transit (Total 418), we are short about 182 units. By setting mu_hat to 1068, the backend calculates: base_stock (approx 1068) - total pipeline (813) = ~255 unit order, which compensates for the 468 lost units while accounting for the current demand level and safety stock.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the system faces a stockout (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 219. The 'In-transit' inventory is 1034 units, but this includes 468 units confirmed lost (Orders from P3, P4, P8, P16), making the effective pipeline 566 units (1034 - 468). Recent demand (P31-P42) is stable at an average of 210.5 units per period. The lead time for successful deliveries has recently varied between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.0 over the last 5 arrivals (P39-P41). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 468 phantom 'In-transit' units, mu_hat is set using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period coverage (L=2 + 1) at approximately 632 units (210.5 * 3). To offset the backend's pipeline overestimation of 468 units, mu_hat is set to 1100 (632 + 468), forcing the logic 'base_stock - 1034' to result in a meaningful order that replenishes stock and covers the high demand regime.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand of 176. The 'In-transit' figure of 1123 units includes 468 units confirmed lost (Orders from P3, P4, P8, P16), making the effective pipeline 655 units (P42: 221, P43: 115, plus others likely from P33, P35). Note that the order from P33 (214 units) and P35 (105 units) are significantly overdue (11 and 9 periods respectively), suggesting they might also be lost; however, I will remain conservative and stick to the 468-unit known loss. Demand has stabilized in a high regime, averaging 204.6 units over the last 28 periods (P16-P43). Lead times for successful deliveries currently fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2 periods. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 468 phantom units in 'In-transit', I must explicitly set mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period coverage (L=2 + 1) at a mean demand of 205: (3 * 205) = 615. To compensate for the 468 lost units the OR engine thinks are coming, I set mu_hat to 615 + 468 = 1083. This ensures the engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic results in an order that maintains actual availability.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Cumulative confirmed/highly likely lost stock remains at least 468 units (P3, P4, P8, P16). P33 (214 units) and P35 (105 units) are now also critically overdue (9+ periods), potentially increasing lost stock to 787 units; monitoring these for one more period before confirming loss.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we face a critical inventory situation. Demand remains in a high-volume regime (averaging approx. 200 units/period since Period 16). The lead time for successful deliveries currently averages 2-3 periods. However, the system is plagued by chronic shipment losses. In-transit inventory is listed as 1125 units, but a significant portion of this is confirmed or highly likely to be lost: P3, P4, P8, P16 (468 units) are long-confirmed lost. Additionally, orders from P33 (214 units) and P35 (105 units) are now 12 and 10 periods overdue respectively, totaling 787 units that are physically absent but 'visible' to the OR backend. The effective pipeline is actually only 338 units (P42, P43, P44). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 'ghost' units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level, effectively neutralizing the 787 lost units. Target base stock is calculated to cover demand for (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 200 = 600) plus the 787 units the OR engine thinks it already has in transit. I will use L=3 to reflect the realistic delivery timeframe.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss total increased to 787 units: P3, P4, P8, P16 (468 units) and now P33, P35 (319 units) are confirmed lost after 10+ periods of non-arrival. Effective pipeline = (In-transit - 787).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing a systemic shipment loss of 787 units (from periods 3, 4, 8, 16, 33, and 35), which are reflected in the 'In-transit' figure of 1428 but will never arrive. The effective pipeline is actually 641 units (1428 - 787). Demand has been consistently high since Period 16, with the last 10 periods averaging 201 units. Lead times for successful deliveries fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering (since it believes the pipeline is full with the lost 787 units), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. My target base stock is (L+1) * 201 + Safety Stock. With L=2, base stock should be around 603 + 150 = 753. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline', and it uses pipeline=1428, I must inflate mu_hat so that (mu_hat + safety_stock) - 1428 results in a meaningful order. To maintain a healthy flow, I set mu_hat to 1600 (approx 200 * 8) to force the backend to account for the phantom inventory and continue ordering to meet the 200+ unit/period demand.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we have 97 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' balance of 1331 units. Based on established carry-over insights, 787 of these units are confirmed lost (P3, P4, P8, P16, P33, P35). Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 1331 - 787 = 544 units (consisting of orders from P42, P43, P46). Demand remains in a high regime, with the average of the last 10 periods (P37-P46) being approximately 201 units. To maintain the target base stock, we must account for the OR backend's inability to recognize lost stock. The backend calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline). Since it sees the full 1331 units 'In-transit', it underestimates the need by 787 units. We compensate by setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Expected_Demand. With L=2 (promised) and high demand (~201), a standard mu_hat would be ~603. To offset the 787 lost units, we set mu_hat = 603 + 787 = 1390. This ensures the backend places an order sufficient to cover demand while ignoring the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current volatility of the high-demand regime.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we are managing a systemic shipment loss of 787 units (from Periods 3, 4, 8, 16, 33, and 35), which remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 1331. The effective pipeline inventory is 544 units (1331 - 787), consisting of orders from P42, P43, and P46. Demand has been stable in a high-demand regime since Period 16; the last 10 periods (P38-P47) average 204 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and effective pipeline at 544, we must ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods of demand). Total demand needed is roughly 3 * 204 = 612 units. Because the OR backend 'sees' 1331 units in transit, it will perceive a massive surplus and stop ordering unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to offset the 787 lost units. I set mu_hat to 1400 (approx. 3 * 204 + 787) to force the backend to maintain a healthy flow for the final periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the objective is to ensure sufficient inventory for the final period (P50) while accounting for significant systemic shipment losses. Total confirmed lost stock is 787 units (Orders from P3, P4, P8, P16, P33, and P35). The 'In-transit' count of 1434 units includes these 787 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is only 647 units (1434 - 787). Demand has been stable in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 204 units over the last 10 periods. The lead time for successful deliveries remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of 2. For mu_hat, I am using an explicit value to compensate for the OR backend's use of the total 'In-transit' figure. The target base stock for a 2-period lead time (L+1 = 3 periods of demand) is approximately 612 units (3 * 204). Since the backend subtracts the full 1434 units from its base stock calculation, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the necessary order. However, since P50 is the final period, the goal is to have enough stock to meet P49-P50 demand without over-ordering. Given the effective pipeline of 647 and zero on-hand, we are already positioned to cover the remaining demand (~408 units) if lead times permit. I will use 'calculate' for L and 'recent_N' for demand to maintain the backend's internal logic, while ensuring the cap does not prevent necessary fulfillment.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with the most recent 10-period average (P40-P49) being 211 units. The total 'In-transit' stock is 1226 units, but 787 of these are confirmed/highly likely lost (P3, P4, P8, P16, P33, P35). This leaves an effective pipeline of 439 units (Orders from P42, P43, P48). To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am explicitly setting mu_hat. The target base stock must cover (L+1) periods. Using L=3 (recent observation), we need to cover 4 periods. Target = 211 * 4 = 844. However, the OR backend sees 1226 in pipeline. To force an order that bridges the gap between 439 effective and 1226 reported, I set mu_hat = 844 + (1226 - 439) = 1631. This compensates for the 787 lost units the backend thinks are coming.
