Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 of 50. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' starts with 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], with a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Since this is the initial period without clear evidence of a demand shift or lead time deviation, I will use the 'default' methods. This allows the OR backend to use the promised lead time (L=4) and the full history of 5 samples to calculate the base stock. The (L+1) factor ensures we attempt to cover demand during the order lead time plus the review period (total 5 periods of demand), which is standard for a 4-period lead time environment.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 141 units with a promised lead time (L) of 4. As expected for L=4, no units arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0). Initial on-hand inventory was 0, resulting in 108 units of lost sales. Current pipeline (in-transit) is 141. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the recently observed 108 in Period 1. The mean demand is approximately 110.8 units per period. Since L=4, the review plus lead time period is (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4) and use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (all 5 past samples + Period 1) to capture the current demand level. This will set a base stock level to cover 5 periods of demand (~550 units), minus the 141 already in transit, to satisfy future demand while balancing against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. No inventory has arrived yet because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [108, 74] (Periods 1-2). The mean of the most recent 5 samples (116, 138, 94, 108, 74) is 106. Since the lead time L=4, the review period is L+1=5. The backend base stock is calculated as (L+1) * mean. To ensure we cover demand during the lead time, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand trend. While Period 2 demand was low (74), it's too early to confirm a sustained regime shift, so an N of 5 balances stability and responsiveness.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive during P5 (visible in P6's decision phase). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 424 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand over the last 5 historical samples was [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean ~111), and in-game demand for P1-P3 has been [108, 74, 119] (mean ~100). There is no confirmation of lead-time deviation yet as we haven't reached the arrival window. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and include all 8 available demand data points (5 historical + 3 in-game) for calculations to maximize statistical stability until a trend evolves. I'm using recent_N=8 to capture all known demand data.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the 'Lead Time Definition', an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 4 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Therefore, seeing 'arrived=0' in the history for Periods 1-4 is expected behavior. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no stock has arrived yet. The demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] from the prompt and the recent period demands [108, 74, 119, 124] show a relatively stable mean around 110-115. I will use the default lead time (4) and use all available recent data to estimate demand, as no significant regime shift is yet confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrival in Period 5 of the order placed in Period 1 (5 - 1 = 4). Historical demand over the last 10 samples (5 from pre-game, 5 from game history) are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51]. The mean demand is approximately 103.3 units. In Period 5, demand dropped to 51, which is significantly lower than the average, but since it is only one data point, I will use a slightly larger N for recent demand calculation to smooth out the volatility while acknowledging the recent trend. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 422) plus on-hand (90) equals 512. Expected demand over L+1 (5 periods) is roughly 515. The OR engine will decide the order quantity based on these parameters. I'll set L to default (4), and mu/sigma to recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent game dynamics (avg ~95) which are slightly lower than the pre-game samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by arrivals in Period 5 (P1 order) and Period 6 (P2 order). The average lead time is exactly 4. Demand for the last 6 periods has been [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67]. There appears to be a drop in demand over the last two periods (mean of ~59 vs earlier mean of ~106). Since we have limited data (6 samples total), I will use all available demand data (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid overreacting to the recent two-period dip while still acknowledging the promised lead time L=4. This ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods) is grounded in observed behavior. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 309, which includes orders from P3 (146), P4 (139), and P6 (24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand for the last seven periods is [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103]. The average demand is 92.2 and the standard deviation is 27.2. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the conclusion of shipments from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arriving in Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Currently, we have 203 units on-hand and 204 units in-transit (orders from Periods 4, 6, and 7). Calculations for the base stock policy (L+1 periods) should cover a total lead time of 5 periods (4 lead time + 1 current decision period). The inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 407 units, which is slightly above the expected 5-period demand (92.2 * 5 = 461). Given the demand variability, I will use all available samples (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a stable baseline for the OR engine.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of historical arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8) consistently confirms a lead time (L) of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory is currently healthy with 250 units on-hand and 173 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8). Recent demand since Period 5 (when stock became available) has been: 51, 67, 103, 92 (average: 78.25), which is notably lower than the pre-stock history (112, 97, 116, 138, 94; average: 111.4). I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent lower demand regime observed after fulfillment began, while maintaining L at the default (promised) value of 4. This ensures we don't over-order while accounting for the full (L+1)=5 period cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 5: average decreased from ~111 to ~78 (-30%) following the start of inventory fulfillment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $250.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a steady state with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods (P1-P4 all arrived exactly at L=4). Demand analysis shows a shift starting around Period 5 when on-hand inventory became available. The pre-availability demand mean (P1-P4) was 106.25, while the post-availability mean (P5-P9) is 82.6. Period 10's starting on-hand inventory is 150, and there are 186 units in transit (ordered in P6, P7, P8, P9). Since P5 had no order, no arrival is expected during Period 10 (concluding P9 showed arrived=0, and P5 order was 0). The next arrival will be the 24 units ordered in P6, arriving in Period 11. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~83) and calculate for lead time to maintain the confirmed 4-period cycle. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of the current demand regime.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 95 units with a pipeline of 282 units. Historical analysis confirms a lead time of 4 periods (as seen in Period 10's arrival of the Period 6 order). Since Period 5, demand has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the initial out-of-stock period. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=6 (Periods 5-10) to capture this post-startup demand regime, which averages approximately 82 units per period. This gives a (1+L) forecast of 410 units. I am also using recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility in this period range. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $4.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $474.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are managing a lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 5, when inventory first became available, demand has stabilized into a lower regime. The demand for Periods 1-4 averaged ~106, while demand for Periods 5-11 (post-stockout) averaged ~87.8. To optimize for this most recent regime, I will use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The pipeline inventory (313 units) plus current on-hand (14 units) total 327. Based on the current average demand (~88), this covers approximately 3.7 periods of demand, which is slightly below the 5 periods (L+1) required for safety. The OR backend will order to reach the base stock level, which I am anchoring to the recent 7-period demand statistics to reflect the lower consumption rate and avoid excessive holding costs ($1/unit).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 3 units, with 333 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by recent arrivals from Period 8 arriving in Period 12). Demand analysis shows a shift starting around Period 5; before Period 5, demand averaged ~108, while from Period 5 to 12, it averaged ~91.1. However, the last three periods (P10-P12) have seen a slight resurgence in demand (79, 122, 119, average ~106.7). Given the promised lead time L=4, we must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using N=8 for mu_hat captures the post-shift environment more accurately than the full history, while N=5 for sigma_hat reflects the recent increase in volatility. These parameters will help maintain a buffer against stockouts without excessive holding costs.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14. Looking at the history, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in Carry-over Insights and subsequent arrivals). Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 9 order (only 13 units) was insufficient to meet Period 13 demand (102 demand, only 16 units available). Demand reached a low in Period 5 (~51) but has been trending back up over the last few periods (100, 79, 122, 119, 102), with the average over the last 5 periods being approximately 104.4. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (N=5 covers Periods 9-13) to capture this recovery in demand and safeguard against stockouts, as we have 442 units in-transit. The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on L=4 and our recent demand mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: average demand for last 5 periods (P9-P13) has risen to ~104 vs the previous low regime of ~78.

Daily Reward (R_t): $480.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an inventory stockout (starting on-hand was 120, demand was 128, leaving 0). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on historical arrivals (e.g., P10 order arrived P14). Demand has clearly rebounded from the dip seen in Periods 5-9; the last 5 periods (P10-P14) show an average demand of 110.0 (79, 122, 119, 102, 128). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this recovered demand level across the lead time + review period (1+4=5 periods). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the recent volatility. In-transit inventory (435 units) includes orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14, which are expected to arrive in P15, P16, P17, and P18 respectively. Setting parameters to recent levels helps the OR engine maintain a sufficient base stock to prevent further stockouts as demand stabilizes at this higher level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 110.0, returning to pre-fulfillment levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we enter with 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 506 units. Historically, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Since Period 13, the SKU has faced stockouts because demand recovered to pre-fulfillment levels (~110-120 units) while the pipeline was restricted by the low-demand regime observations from Periods 5-9. In Period 15, we sold 72 units (limited by supply) against 112 units of demand. To ensure the OR backend generates a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The last 5 demand samples are [122, 119, 102, 128, 112], averaging 116.6. This allows the system to adjust to the higher stabilized demand while accounting for recent volatility. The lead time is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods remains accurate.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P11-P16: 122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 170) shows a significant upward trend, with the most recent demand (170) being much higher than the historical average. The mean over the last 6 periods is approximately 125, but the stockouts in P13-P16 indicate that actual demand likely exceeds the 'sold' units. To account for this growth and avoid further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 demand samples with a slight manual adjustment to reflect the most recent spike of 170. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 474 in-transit. With a 4-period lead time, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). L is confirmed at 4 periods based on history.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed at Period 16 (170 units); average demand for last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 126.2, indicating a likely new regime above the previous stabilization point of 110.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. Historically, Period 16 (170) and Period 17 (213) show a massive demand spike compared to the previous stable mean of ~110. The average of the last 3 periods is 165. The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) due to this accelerating demand and the fixed 4-period lead time. Pipeline inventory is 526, covering the next 4 periods of demand if demand stays high. However, to stop the cycle of stockouts, mu_hat must reflect the most recent regime shift. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand burst (P15-P17) and lead time is stable at 4. The OR engine will aim for a base stock level that accounts for L+1 (5) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: Period 17 demand (213) follows Period 16 (170); 3-period average (P15-P17) is 165, significantly higher than the previous stabilization point of 110 (+50%). Stockouts have occurred for 5 consecutive periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a significant demand surge that began at Period 16. Recent demands are 170, 213, and 166, resulting in consecutive stockouts despite consistent arrivals. The current lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit units at 662, we must ensure the base stock levels (covering L+1 periods) reflect this new higher regime. The average demand of the last 3 periods is approximately 183. We select N=3 to capture this most recent sustained regime shift. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent high-demand period will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the higher volatility observed during the surge, aiming to eliminate the stockout condition.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a significant demand surge that began around Period 16. Current demand (P16-P19: 170, 213, 166, 231) shows a 4-period average of 195 units, which is a nearly 80% increase from the previous stabilization level of 110. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. Despite consistent ordering, we have faced 7 consecutive periods of stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0) because our pipeline of orders (placed when demand expectations were lower) is insufficient to meet the current higher demand regime. To rectify this, the OR parameters must reflect the new mean. I'm choosing N=4 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime exactly, and N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes (std of [170, 213, 166, 231] is ~31.8). The L parameter will remain at default as lead times are consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 16-19 average demand is 195 units, a significant shift from the previous average of 110 (+77%).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 16. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 195.6, which represents a nearly 80% increase from the previous stabilization level of 110. For 8 consecutive periods (P13-P20), demand has exceeded arrival capacity, resulting in zero ending inventory. While arrivals are consistent (lead time of 4 periods remains stable), the quantities arriving (based on historical orders placed before the spike) are insufficient to meet current demand levels. To address this, mu_hat must be set to reflect this new regime (N=5). As demand volatility also likely increased during this surge, sigma_hat will be calculated based on the same recent window. This approach will raise the base stock level to satisfy the higher demand and clear the stockout situation, while the OR engine's cap and the provided lead time (L=4) will manage the order sizes against the current pipeline inventory of 897 units.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P20) average demand confirmed at 195.6 units (+78% shift). Consistent 4-period lead time remains stable.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 16. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 195.17 units ([170+213+166+231+198+193]/6). This is nearly double the previous stabilization point of ~110. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. Despite large quantities in transit, the system is currently stocking out (on-hand is 0) because recent arrivals are being fully consumed by the higher demand. I am setting the demand parameters based on this new regime (N=6) to ensure the base stock levels calculated by the OR backend reflect the elevated demand profile (1+L periods of demand) and the increased volatility associated with this spike.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. The average demand for the most recent 7 periods (P16-P22) is 178.1, which is significantly higher than the previous stabilization point of 110. Period 22 demand was 176, showing continued stability in this high range. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival from Period 18 in Period 22. In-transit inventory is currently high (774 units), and with 73 units on-hand, we are starting to fulfill demand more effectively, though stockouts were frequent in preceding periods. I will set mu_hat using the recent 7-period average (N=7) to capture this current regime, and sigma_hat using the same period to reflect the current volatility. This aims to maintain enough stock to satisfy the higher demand while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P22) average demand confirmed at 178.1 units. 4-period lead time remains stable with latest arrival at P22.

Daily Profit: $972.00, Daily Holding Cost: $56.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $916.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established around Period 16 remains sustained through Period 23. Over the last 8 periods (P16-P23), demand has averaged 198.75 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization point of 110. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 19 order in Period 23. Period 23 demand (243) was particularly high, resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 56. With 709 units in transit (ordered P20-P23), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the duration of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility. L remains at the promised/observed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P23) average demand remains stable at ~199 units (+80% shift from P10-P15). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $671.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history from Period 16 to Period 24 indicates a sustained high-demand regime. Specifically, the demand from Period 19 onwards (19 onwards: 231, 198, 193, 176, 243, 195) averages approximately 206 units. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the entirety of this high-demand shift starting at Period 16, which averages 198.3 units per period (170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176, 243, 195). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 22, 23, and 24). The inventory position is currently 816 (109 on-hand + 707 in-transit). Given L=4, the base stock targets coverage for (L+1)=5 periods. 198.3 * 5 = 991.5 units. The OR backend will use the provided recent stats to calculate the base stock and place a replenishment order to cover the pipeline gap, while the cap helps mitigate over-ordering if the variance is high.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P24) average demand stabilized at 198.3 units (+80% shift from the P10-P15 baseline). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is now well-established, starting around Period 16. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is approximately 197.0 units, while the average for the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) is 198.4 units. This indicates that a mean demand around 198 units is a reliable forecast for the current state. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With only 58 units on-hand and a significant pipeline (799 units), the goal is to maintain the base stock level (L+1 periods of coverage) matching this new high-demand regime to prevent further stockouts and maximize profit. I am using recent_N=10 to capture this stabilized high-demand period while smoothing out short-term fluctuations.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-regime state starting from Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable window (Periods 20 to 26), the average demand is approximately 197.1 units per period (198, 193, 176, 243, 195, 185, 188). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 22 order in Period 26. I will use recent_N with N=11 (tracking from the start of the high regime in Period 16 to the current decision point) to capture this elevated mean and volatility while excluding the lower historical demand. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the (L+1)=5 periods of systemic demand required to maintain service levels in this high-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $788.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 16 onwards) has a mean of approximately 196 units. Period 27 ending inventory is 0 due to a demand spike (219 units), but the last arrival (161 units from P23) suggests we are roughly in balance with the 4-period lead time. No shipments appear lost; the order from P24 (246 units) is expected to arrive in Period 28. Using recent_N=12 captures the High-demand regime starting at P16. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent period (P16-P28), the average daily demand is approximately 196.4 units. Since Period 21, demand has consistently fluctuated around this level with a standard deviation of approximately 23.3. The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory stands at 33 on-hand with 790 in-transit (orders from P25, P26, P27, and P28). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (recent_N=13) to capture this established high-demand regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand data. This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate and provides enough safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 13-21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $816.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we observe a stable high-demand regime that began around Period 16. The demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) has been [185, 188, 219, 213, 215], resulting in an average of 204 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 25 order in Period 29. On-hand inventory is currently low (44 units), but there is a significant pipeline (782 units) following aggressive ordering in recent periods to match the high-demand shift. To maintain service levels for this high-demand regime, I will use a recent_N window for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations, specifically setting N=14 to capture the behavior since the regime shift (P16 onwards). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current average demand of ~198-204 units plus lead-time safety stock.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P29) average demand is approximately 201 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 16. In the most recent 15 periods (Period 16 to Period 30), the average demand is approximately 199.5 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the latest arrival in Period 30 (ordered in P26). The current on-hand inventory is low (5 units), but there is a significant pipeline (825 units) to cover upcoming demand. Since there are no observed shifts in lead time or demand mean in the 'high regime,' I will use N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized high-demand behavior. For L, I use the 'calculate' method to utilize the stable history of observed 4-period lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $748.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently at its highest observed level. The average demand since Period 16 is approximately 199.3 units, but significantly, the last 10 periods (P22-P31) show an upward creep with an average of 210.5 units, and Period 31 reached a peak of 276. My goal is to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is 862 units, the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of high demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, which provides a robust mean (~200) and standard deviation for the OR engine's safety stock calculation. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16 to 31 shows high volatility with a baseline shift to ~200 units and a recent peak of 276 in Period 31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $724.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from a baseline of ~110 to a higher-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent stable regime from Period 16 to Period 32, the average demand is approximately 201 units. Period 31 saw a peak of 276 units, while Period 32 returned to 186. The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods across almost all historical deliveries (e.g., Period 32's arrival was ordered in Period 28). To capture the current high-demand environment while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering Period 16 to Period 32). This ensures the OR backend uses a localized mean of ~201 and the associated standard deviation to manage safety stock effectively. Lead time remains set to the stable 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $672.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 33, the mean demand is approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30. The most recent demand figures (186 in P32 and 182 in P33) are slightly lower than the regime average but still significantly higher than the earlier baseline. I will use the last 18 periods (P16-P33) to capture this regime shift accurately for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 33 of the order placed in Period 29 (33 - 29 = 4). Therefore, I will maintain L = 4 using the default method. Setting N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock based on the current high-demand distribution while accounting for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P33) average is 201.2 units; demand remains stable but volatile compared to the pre-P16 baseline.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 201 units. While highly volatile (recent demand ranging from 171 to 276), the mean has stabilized. The lead time remains consistent and reliable at 4 periods, as confirmed by latest arrivals (P30 order arriving P34). Current on-hand inventory is 104 units following Period 34 demand resolution. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 (covering the regime from P16 to P34) will provide the most accurate forecast and volatility estimate for the current sustained regime, allowing the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock while accounting for recent high-demand peaks.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 35 is 200.7 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 27.6 units. While recent periods (P33-P34) saw slightly lower demand (182, 171), Period 35 bounced back to 222, confirming the regime remains active. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P31 order arrived in P35). To determine the base stock, I will use recent_N with N=20 to cover the entire high-demand regime from P16-P35. This ensures the mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained high volume and volatility. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), accounting for the current on-hand inventory (101) and significant pipeline inventory (739).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 36, the average demand is approximately 204.6 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) show an average of 200.2 units (186, 182, 171, 222, 240), indicating sustained levels around this mark with some volatility (standard deviation ~28.5). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals through Period 36. I will set L to 'default' (4 periods). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=21 (covering the current regime since P16) to capture the long-term average of this high-demand stage. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=21 to properly account for the observed volatility in this regime, ensuring the OR engine maintains an appropriate safety stock levels for the ~$4 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P36) average stabilized at ~205 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 205 units. Recent demand (P33-P37: 182, 171, 222, 240, 196) has an average of 202.2 units and remains moderately volatile (std \u2248 28). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 37 of the order placed in Period 33. I will set the lead time to the promised 4 periods using the 'default' method. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=22 (covering the regime from P16 to P37) to capture this sustained high-demand level across the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=22 to capture the increased volatility associated with this regime. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (current period + 4-period lead time) while accounting for the current mean and standard deviation.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. The average demand since Period 30 (the last 9 periods) is approximately 201 units. Recent demand (P34-P38) has been 171, 222, 240, 196, and 170, averaging 199.8 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 72 and in-transit at 831, the pipeline is well-stocked, but we must maintain the base stock to cover the (L+1) horizon (5 periods of demand ~ 1000 units). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime while smoothing recent fluctuations. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=20 to reflect the current regime's volatility.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-demand, high-volatility state since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data segment (from Period 36 to 39), demand values have been 240, 196, 170, and 171. This suggests a slight cooling from the peak of 276 (Period 31), but demand is still roughly 80% higher than the early baseline. The recent 5-period average (P35-P39) is approximately 199.8 units. I will use N=24 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the behavior of this high-demand regime that began at Period 16, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the sustained shift and volatility while maintaining the confirmed 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is currently low (63), but with a large pipeline (847), the system needs to maintain this base stock to prevent further stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs if demand softens.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility, high-demand regime since Period 16. The average demand for the most recent 25 periods (P16-P40) is approximately 201 units, which is consistent with the established carry-over insights. Recent demand fluctuates between 170 and 276. Using N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations captures this sustained regime while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods since the start of the game (confirmed by arrivals in P37, P38, P39, and P40), so the 'calculate' method is appropriate for L to reflect this stability. The on-hand inventory is 67, and there are 770 units in transit (ordered in periods 37, 38, 39, and 40), which aligns with the 4-period lead time and ensures coverage for the next several periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 205 units. Recent demand (P37-P41) has been [196, 170, 171, 223, 226], averaging 197.2 units, which is consistent with the sustained shift noted in previous insights. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival in Period 41 of the order placed in Period 37. To set OR parameters, I will use a regime-specific window (N=26, covering P16-P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility accurately. The L parameter is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistently observed. These parameters allow the OR backend to maintain a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current high level while managing the inventory risk associated with the observed variance.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P36-P42) has maintained a high-demand regime with an average of approximately 211 units, showing slightly higher sustained volume compared to the previous stabilization at ~205. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P38 order in P42. Current on-hand inventory is 64, with 785 units in transit. Given the target service level implied by the profit/holding cost ratio (95% service level is not directly used by the engine, but the parameters should support it), I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this most recent stabilization around 211 units. This ensures the (L+1) demand window is sufficiently covered. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P36-P42) average stabilized at ~211 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $638.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we observe a stable demand regime and consistent lead times. The confirmed high-demand regime since Period 36 has an average of approximately 211 units. The most recent demand (P43) was 176, but the 8-period mean (P36-P43) is 200.2, and the 5-period mean (P39-P43) is 203.0. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, verified by every shipment since Period 5. On-hand inventory is 66, with a healthy pipeline of 843 units. Since the demand is stable but has periodic spikes (e.g., 223, 226, 219 in recent periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while excluding older, lower-demand data. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for the current ~200 unit/period average demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed variance (sigma).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 9 periods (P36-P44), the average demand is 203.2 units with moderate volatility. The last three periods (P42, P43, P44) saw demands of 219, 176, and 208 respectively. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 40 order in Period 44. Currently, the system has 8 units on-hand and 850 in-transit (orders from P41, P42, P43, and P44). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~80%). Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture the current stable-but-high regime, while sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to account for the current volatility profile.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P36-P44) average demand stabilized at 203.2 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-regime range since Period 36. Examining the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the mean demand is 203.3 units, compared to the P16-P35 average which was similar (~202). The standard deviation over the last 10 periods is approximately 25 units. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival in P45 (ordered P41, lead time 4). Given we are at Period 46 and the simulation ends at Period 50, we need to cover the remaining horizon (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand is 40 and in-transit is 822. The in-transit inventory is very high relative to expected demand (203.3 * 5 = 1016.5) but many of these units are scheduled for future arrivals. I will use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the current stabilized high-demand regime, ensuring parameters are tuned to the most relevant recent history.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistent high-regime following a stabilization at Period 36. Analyzing the demand from Period 36 through Period 46, the average demand is 203.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 24 units. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods as evidenced by continuous arrivals aligning with orders placed 4 periods prior. Currently, we are at Period 47 with 53 units on-hand and 802 units in-transit (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46). The expected arrival for Period 47 is the order from Period 43 (236 units). I will use the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the statistics of this sustained regime (P36-P46). Setting L to default (4) as the observed lead time is stable and matches the promised lead time. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P36-P46) average confirmed at 203.7 units with lead time stable at 4 periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 36. Analyzing the most recent data (P36-P47, 12 samples), the average demand is approximately 203.8 units with a standard deviation of about 23.3. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the latest arrival in Period 47. To ensure the OR engine captures this specific regime's characteristics, I am setting N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This balances the need for stability with the higher demand and volatility observed in this segment. On-hand inventory is currently 58 with 774 units in-transit (orders from P44, P45, P46, P47), which appropriately covers the pipeline for a 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $825.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 36, with an average demand of approximately 203 units. The most recent demand at Period 48 was 208 units, consistent with this observation. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods, with the arrival in Period 48 (ordered in P44) confirming this. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), a service level of 80% is targeted by the base-stock policy. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the regime from Period 36 to 48) to capture the current mean and volatility while excluding previous lower-demand regimes. This ensures the inventory level is sufficient to meet the sustained demand of ~200+ units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $860.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are at the end of the simulation. The demand regime has been consistently high since Period 16, with the most recent sustained average (P36-P49) hovering around 206 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P45-P49) had an average demand of 215 units, with a slight peak in the most recent period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 49. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, which justifies a healthy safety stock. To ensure the backend captures the current high-demand reality and volatility, I will use recent_N with N=14 (covering P36 to P49) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable but high-demand behavior seen over the final quarter of the game history. This ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the (L+1) demand window (5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P36-P49) average confirmed at 206.5 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P45-P49) averaging 215.0 units.
