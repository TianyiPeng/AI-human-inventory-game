Over the last 4 periods (P15-P18), demand has surged to an average of 165 (112, 170, 213, 166), causing consistent stockouts as inventory arrivals (based on older, lower demand estimates) fail to keep up. \n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: We currently have 0 on-hand inventory.

Total pipeline (excluding what arrives this period) + current order should meet this. Pipeline relevant for P23 is approx 100+126+200 = 426.

Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because the pipeline (877) already exceeds its calculated base-stock level (derived from the full history including early low-demand periods). However, utilizing the (L+1) logic with current demand (~200/period), we need to cover 5 periods (1000 units). Total current assets (113 + 764) = 877. This leaves a gap of roughly 123 units to cover the next 5 periods.

However, with demand at ~200/period, those 760 units will be consumed over the next 4 arrivals. \n6. **Final Decision**: I will override the OR recommendation of 0.

Any order placed after P45 will have limited or no time to be sold before the game concludes at Period 50. \n5. **OR Recommendation**: The OR baseline suggests 0 units because the pipeline (900) + on-hand (44) = 944 units, which covers roughly 4.7 periods of demand (~200 units/period).

Total demand to cover is ~1000 units (5 periods * 200). Current total inventory is 944 units. An order of ~50-100 units is needed to ensure we don't stock out in the final periods (P48-P50).

This aligns with the 'carry-over insight' from Period 22/32 indicating a stabilized high-demand regime of ~200-227 units.\n4. **Game Horizon Constraint**: We are at Period 45 of 50.
