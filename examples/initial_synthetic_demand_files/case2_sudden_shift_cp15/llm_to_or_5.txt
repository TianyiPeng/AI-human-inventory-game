Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand within this same period. Historical demand data shows five periods: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], with an average demand of 111.4 units and a standard deviation of approximately 17.0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the OR backend logic will target a high service level (~80%). Since there is no seasonal data or evidence of lead-time shifts yet, I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to establish a baseline based on the provided history.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 127 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived immediately, and we ended the period with 19 units after a demand of 108. The historical demand average (including the 5 prior samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the new sample [108]) is approximately 110.8. Given the lead time is 0, we need to cover demand for current period (Review + Lead = 1 period). Since there is no clear trend or seasonality established yet, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which effectively averages the available history to stabilize the base stock level against the observed volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first two periods, the observed lead time has been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history (including the provided 5 samples) shows values of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74]. The mean of these 7 samples is approximately 105.5 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 20 units. Since 7 samples provide a reasonable stable base and there is no strong evidence yet of a regime shift or seasonality (no specific calendar dates provided), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the most relevant demand profile. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the observed 0-period lead time. This configuration balances the service level for a high-profit item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost) while accounting for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 4. Analysis of the history shows that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history (including the provided past samples and the three game periods) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119]. These values fluctuate around a mean of approx 107 units with no clear evidence of a sustained regime shift yet. Period 2 saw a dip to 74, but Period 3 returned to 119, suggesting stochastic variation rather than a permanent change. Given the 0-period lead time, we need enough inventory to cover the current period's demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting, selecting N=5 to capture recent volatility while smoothing out the Period 2 outlier. Sigma_hat is set to default to ensure we cover variability across the review cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Historical demand for the first 5 samples (including pre-game and Period 1-4) are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the concluded demands are [108, 74, 119, 124]. The most recent four periods show an average demand of 106.25 units. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent with the game history, all orders from Period 1 to 4 arrived within the same period (lead_time = 0). Inventory currently stands at 0 after a stockout in Period 4 (sold 123 vs demand 124). Given the profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level q is 4/(4+1) = 0.80. Since demand appears relatively stable with no clear seasonal trend yet (only 4-5 data points), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current mean and volatility, ensuring we cover the high demand seen in Period 4 to prevent further stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $129.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand history for 'chips(Regular)' across 10 available data points (5 past demand samples provided: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and 5 recorded periods: [108, 74, 119, 124, 51]). The overall mean is approximately 103.3. There is a noticeable drop in demand in the most recent period (51 units), but it follows a high demand period (124 units), suggesting volatility rather than a sustained regime shift yet. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'default' lead time of 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent high volatility (124 down to 51) while bridging to the historical average. This helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock level to handle potential spikes despite the recent low demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $213.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-6 confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some volatility: the five initial samples averaged 111.4, while recent observations (Periods 1-6) have been 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, and 67 (average ~90.5). A demand regime shift appears to have occurred around Period 5 with two consecutive lower demand readings (51 and 67), though it is not yet sustained enough for a definitive carry-over insight. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), we should aim for a high service level. L is set to default (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent downward trend in demand while maintaining enough variance to protect against stockouts given the recent high demands in Periods 3 and 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods has been [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103], with an additional 5 data points provided in the context [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Calculating the descriptive statistics across all 12 points: Mean \u2248 100.25, Std Dev \u2248 25.66. Looking at the 'conclude' messages, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Profits are $4.0 and holding costs are $1.0, leading to a critical ratio of 0.8 (4/(4+1)), which translates to a z-score of approximately 0.84. Since there is no clear trend or seasonal evidence (only generic 'Period_X' dates), I will use the 'default' method for L (0 periods), mu_hat (total demand across review+lead), and sigma_hat to utilize the full historical sample efficiently for this stable demand distribution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $338.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the current on-hand inventory for 'chips(Regular)' is 30 units with no units in-transit. Analysis of the history (Periods 1-8) shows an actual lead time (L) of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The historical demand for Periods 1-8 is [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92]. Including the provided past demands [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the overall mean is approximately 99.6 and the standard deviation is approximately 24.5. There are no definitive regime shifts or strong seasonal trends visible in the 'Period_N' date format yet, although demand shows moderate volatility. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to average the 0-period observations. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' (all-sample statistics) as the demand appears relatively stable around the long-term mean without a sustained new pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $379.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows relative demand stability with a historical mean of approximately 93 units per period (108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100). The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Periods 1 through 9 arrived consistently within the same period (actual lead time = 0). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonal trend in the first 9 periods. Therefore, I am using 'default' settings for lead time and sigma, and 'recent_N' with N=9 for mu_hat to capture the most relevant recent demand average for the review+lead period (1+0=1 period). Profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1) suggests a target service level of 80%, which the OR base-stock policy will aim to satisfy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been fairly stable but shows significant variance. Over the first 10 periods, the average demand is approximately 91.7 units with a standard deviation around 23.9. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time 0 observed in all concluded periods 1-10). The current on-hand inventory is 34 units. To maintain a high service level given the profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the full recent history while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock requirements. Since actual lead time is consistently 0, the 'default' method is appropriate for L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we experienced a stockout (demand 122, sold 112) because the inventory level was insufficient to cover the high demand. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. The demand over the last 11 periods averages 94.45 with a standard deviation of 23.33, but recent demand shows higher volatility (Periods 9-11: 100, 79, 122). To prevent future stockouts and optimize profit given the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile 0.8), I will use the 'default' lead time (0) and calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (capturing the latest demand shifts from Periods 7-11). This ensures the OR backend captures the recent increase in demand variance and mean (avg ~99.2), helping to set a base stock that better protects against stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Regular chips over the last 12 periods has been somewhat volatile but stable around a mean. Observed demands: 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79, 122, 119. I am seeing two instances (Period 4, 11, 12) where ending inventory hit zero, suggesting the current stock levels are barely meeting demand. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since there is no calendar date provided beyond 'Period X', I will rely on recent historical demand. I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture the current demand level while smoothing out the noise from the lower demand points (51, 67). I will set L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Reviewing the demand history for chips(Regular) over the first 13 periods, the mean demand is approximately 98.5 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. Promising lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0 (arrivals occur same-period). There is no obvious seasonal trend yet, but demand is somewhat volatile (ranging from 51 to 124). For Period 14, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the full recent operating regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the high critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.8), targeting roughly the 80th percentile of demand to minimize stockouts while managing holding costs. Given that on-hand inventory is low (17 units) after Period 13, the base stock policy will generate a replenishment order to cover Period 14 demand.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 14 periods, with a mean demand of approximately 99.1 units. Recent periods (P11-P14) show slightly higher demand averaging 117.75 units, leading to several periods of stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. To address the recent stockouts and slight uptick in demand, I will focus on the most recent 10 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the current higher-demand regime while maintaining enough sample size for stability. Setting L to 'calculate' ensures we adapt if lead times shift from the current 0-day trend.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the 15-period history, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand appears to have undergone a regime shift around Period 11, with a noticeable increase in mean. Before Period 11, the average demand was approximately 91.8 units; from Period 11 through 15, the average demand increased to 116.6 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the backend's target service level (q = 0.8) will naturally lean towards maintaining higher inventory to capture sales. On-hand inventory is currently low (6 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: average demand increased from ~92 to ~117 (+27%). Lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Period 11-16 (122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 170) confirms a significantly higher demand regime compared to the first 10 periods. The average demand in this new regime is ~125.5, with the most recent observation spiking to 170. We are currently facing stockouts (ending inventory 0 in 4 out of the last 6 periods), indicating we aren't ordering enough to cover the variability in this higher regime. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this new regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, for mu_hat, the backend will calculate (1+L)*mean_of_last_6. With mean=125.5 and L=0, the base stock will target this higher level to prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($4.0/unit vs $1.0/unit holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: average demand increased from ~92 to ~125 (+35%). Volatility has also increased, peaking at 170 units in Period 16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $584.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, demand averaged around 92 (Periods 1-10). From Period 11 onwards, demand has rapidly accelerated: 122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 170, and most recently 213 in Period 17. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have stocked out in 4 of the last 7 periods, indicating that our 'cap' and 'base_stock' derived from historical averages are insufficient. I am shifting to an 'explicit' forecast to stay ahead of this surge. I estimate the next period's demand at approximately 220 units to account for the current upward trend and high volatility. Lead time is consistently 0. Setting mu_hat to 220 (for 1+L=1 period) helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers this level, and I am increasing sigma_hat explicitly to 45 to reflect the high volatility observed in recent periods (standard deviation of the last 7 samples is ~40).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Period 17 demand reached 213, confirming a move from a mean of ~117 to significantly higher levels (>200). Stockouts in consecutive periods (P16, P17) suggest the OR engine's default cap is lagging behind actual growth.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically (Periods 1-10), demand averaged ~92. From Period 11 onwards, we saw an increase to ~117, then a sharp acceleration in Periods 16-18 with demands of 170, 213, and 166. This suggests a new average of approximately 183 units over the last three periods. Lead time is consistently 0. To prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 16 and 17, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime. This will raise the order cap and base stock level to match the new market reality, while the OR engine balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: average demand increased from ~120 to ~183 (+52%) based on the last 3 periods (P16: 170, P17: 213, P18: 166).

Daily Reward (R_t): $820.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted higher starting around Period 16. In the last four periods (P16-P19), demand values were 170, 213, 166, and 231, resulting in an average of 195. This is significantly higher than the previous regime (~120). We have experienced frequent stockouts (P16, P17, P19) because the OR engine's internal 'cap' (based on historical data) is likely too low to accommodate this growth. To force the OR backend to place larger orders and overcome the stockout trend, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I am setting mu_hat based on the recent average of ~195 (for L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*195). Given the increased volatility (range of 166-231), I am setting sigma_hat to 35 to ensure a sufficient safety stock. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the history of same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 further accelerated: average demand for P16-P19 is ~195 (+60% from the previous ~120 regime). High volatility confirmed with demand reaching 231.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of regime shifts, moving from an initial average of ~92 units (P1-P10) to ~117 units (P11-P15), and currently stabilizing at a much higher level in the most recent periods (P16-P20). The last five demands are 170, 213, 166, 231, and 198, with an average of approximately 195.6. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure the OR engine's 'cap' (which is based on the mean and standard deviation) does not throttle the order below the current high demand levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5. This aligns the ordering logic with the new regime discovered starting Period 16 while accounting for the high volatility (std dev for these 5 samples is ~27, significantly higher than the early game). This should prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 16, 17, and 19.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 stabilized: average demand for P16-P20 is ~196 units with significantly higher volatility (std dev ~27). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 21 (170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193), the mean is 195.17 units with a standard deviation of approximately 24.5. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. In Period 21, demand was 193, and we carry over 27 units of inventory. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), I will set the parameters using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture the current regime across the last 6 periods. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the observed increased mean and volatility while avoiding over-stocking as the growth has stabilized.

Daily Reward (R_t): $663.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 7 periods (P16-P22), the average demand is 192.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22.8. This confirms the stabilization noted in the carry-over insights. Recent demand values (P20: 198, P21: 193, P22: 176) show the high-growth phase has settled into a higher-mean steady state compared to the pre-P16 era. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts seen during the upward trend and accommodate the increased volatility, I am using a recent_N of 7 periods to calculate both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend uses the current regime's statistics for its base-stock and cap calculations. This aligns the inventory levels with the new demand reality (~192 units) rather than being pulled down by the much lower historical data (avg ~100-110).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 16: New mean demand is ~192 units (P16-P22 avg) compared to the previous ~120 regime, with sustained higher volatility (std dev ~23).

Despite the higher orders, frequent stockouts (P16, P17, P19, P23) indicate that the OR engine's internal cap, combined with the default standard deviation calculation, is likely underestimating the required stock to handle current volatility (std dev ~27). To ensure better availability and service levels, mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=8) to capture only the current regime's mean (~199), and sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the recent high volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the elevated and volatile demand patterns seen in the last 8 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 stabilized: New mean demand is ~199 units (P16-P23 avg) with high volatility (std dev ~27). Periodic stockouts occur when demand exceeds 210 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16. In the most recent 9 periods (P16-P24), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 198.3 units, with a standard deviation of about 26.6. The previous 'carry_over_insight' confirms this stable but higher-volatility regime. Period 23 saw a demand spike to 243, resulting in a stockout, while Period 24 had a demand of 195, leaving 28 units on-hand. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maximize reward and prevent stockouts during spikes, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to capture only this high-demand regime. This ensures the OR backend's inventory target (base stock) and ordering cap are calculated based on current market behavior rather than the lower historical average.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25, the mean demand is approximately 197.6 units (samples: 170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176, 243, 195, 185). The standard deviation for this Period 16-25 window is approximately 25.8. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent periodic stockouts caused by the OR engine's order cap lagging behind this higher mean and volatility, I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to isolate this current regime. Setting L to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently meeting actual delivery times. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the stats of the current high-demand state, ensuring the base stock level and the internal cap are high enough to cover the observed demand peaks (up to 243).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-25 confirmed: mean ~198, std dev ~26. This confirms a sustained uplift from the previous Period 11-15 regime (mean ~117).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime that started at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 26, the mean demand is approximately 196.3 units per period (170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176, 243, 195, 185, 188). The standard deviation during this period is approximately 25.5. I will use N=11 (from Period 16 to 26) to capture this specific regime. The lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by every historical 'conclude' message. Given the high stockout risk seen in Period 23 (demand 243), using this recent N-window will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the elevated mean and volatility while respecting the profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $868.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime that began around Period 16. In the most recent periods (P16-P27), the average demand is approximately 198 units, with a standard deviation of about 26. In Period 27, demand spiked to 219, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. The OR engine's 'default' cap (\u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + z*\u03c3\u0302/\u221a(1+L)) is likely constraining the order size too aggressively given the current volatility and frequent stockouts (P23, P27). To ensure the OR engine targets the actual current regime, I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (corresponding to the start of the current regime at P16). This will force the base stock and cap calculation to reflect the ~198 mean and the higher volatility, helping to prevent stockouts when demand exceeds 210 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $846.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 16 remains stable, showing a significantly higher mean and volatility compared to earlier periods. For the period range P16-P28, the average demand is approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of 25. Recent demand in P27 (219) and P28 (213) confirms this high-demand state. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To accurately capture the current regime's parameters while ignoring the lower demand from the first 15 periods, I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering P16 through P28). This ensures that \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 reflect the current high-demand environment, preventing systemic stockouts caused by underestimation of mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P16-P28 confirmed: mean increased to ~201 units (+67% from early periods), with standard deviation ~25. Lead time is stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $856.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 16 remains stable but high. Analysis of demand from Period 16 to 29 shows a mean of approximately 201 units and a standard deviation of approximately 23. In the most recent four periods (P26-P29), demand has been consistently high (188, 219, 213, 215), averaging 208 units. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals in the game history. With on-hand inventory at only 4 units and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1 (suggesting a target service level of 80%), I will use recent_N to capture the current high-demand regime. Although recent_N for N=14 (P16-P29) provides a robust average of ~201, the very recent strength suggests maintaining a slightly higher mu_hat. Using N=14 for mu_hat captures the step-up from P16 onwards, providing about 201 units of cover, which aligns with the observed sustained demand and prevents excessive holding costs while mitigating stockout risk.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 201 units and a standard deviation of 25. Historical demand over the last 15 periods (P16-P30) shows values consistently ranging from 166 to 243. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders within the same period they are placed. To accurately capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime while avoiding the potential lag from using the entire 30-period history (which includes much lower demand periods), I will use the last 15 periods (recent_N=15) to set both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This covers the entire current regime starting from Period 16. The high profit margin relative to holding cost ($4 vs $1) directs the OR engine toward a high service level, which is appropriate given the frequent stockouts observed when demand peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P16-P30 confirmed: mean ~201, std dev ~25. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $884.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 31 reached 276, which is significantly higher than the average in the current regime (P16-P30 mean approx. 201). This suggests a possible further uplift or a peak in volatility. Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover this new peak to avoid stockouts, as seen in Period 31 where ending on-hand was 0 and some demand may have been lost. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 230 to account for recent upward pressure and sigma_hat to 35 to handle the increased volatility (std dev has likely increased with the 276 observation). L remains at 0.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand uplift at Period 31: Demand hit 276, extending the regime's upper range and suggesting a higher mean or significantly increased volatility compared to the previous stable P16-P30 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $670.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand of 276 in Period 31, followed by 186 in Period 32, suggests the demand regime is remaining high but volatile. The average demand since the major shift in Period 16 (P16-P32) is approximately 203 units. However, looking at the last 5 periods (P28-P32: 213, 215, 215, 276, 186), the mean has nudged slightly higher to ~221 units. To avoid stockouts like the one seen in P31 where demand hit 276, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (P28-P32) to capture this potentially higher baseline and the significant increase in volatility (std dev in this window is ~33). Lead time is consistently 0. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat better adapts to the current 'high-intensity' phase compared to the lifetime average.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand regime P28-P32 shows an increased mean of ~221 (+10% from the P16-P27 baseline of ~200) and increased volatility (peak 276).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 28. The last five periods (P29-P33) show demand values of 215, 215, 276, 186, and 182, resulting in an average of ~215. This is slightly higher than the P16-P27 average of ~200. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high volatility (max demand 276) and a 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (critical fractile 0.8), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this latest slightly elevated and volatile regime while maintaining responsiveness to the recent spikes. N=6 covers the period from P28 to P33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $612.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in an elevated regime that began around Period 16, with a further slight uplift and increased volatility observed from Period 31. Recent demands (P31-P34: 276, 186, 182, 171) show an average of 203.75, which is consistent with the P16-P34 average of approximately 201. The spike to 276 in P31 highlights the high volatility in this regime. Lead time is stable at 0 periods. To ensure we capture the high variance (std dev ~26-30 in the current regime) and avoid stockouts during demand peaks like Period 31, I will use recent_N=19 (covering the regime from P16 to P34) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a stable mean while acknowledging the significant volatility seen since Period 16. Using 'recent_N' over the full history prevents underestimating demand by excluding the much lower demand levels seen in the first 10-15 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16 to 34 remains stable at a mean of ~201 with high volatility (std dev ~26). Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit the regime established around Period 16, characterized by a mean of approximately 201 units and significant volatility. Recently, demand has fluctuated between 171 and 276. Period 35 demand was 222, reinforcing this high-demand, high-volatility state. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current state while acknowledging the high variance and periodic spikes (e.g., P31), I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=20 to cover the stabilized P16+ regime. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the recent dispersion, which is crucial for maintaining an adequate service level and avoiding the stockouts seen in Periods 27 and 31. The OR engine's base stock policy (using profit/holding cost) should naturally target a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a confirmed mean of approximately 201 units. In the most recent 10 periods (P27-P36), demand has averaged 222 units, indicating a slight upward drift or sustained high volatility with frequent peaks exceeding 220. Period 36 ended in a stockout (sold 227 against a demand of 240), leaving 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent higher average and account for volatility that has caused recent stockouts, I am using recent_N with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current demand level of ~222 units and the associated high standard deviation, providing sufficient safety stock to minimize further stockouts while lead time remains at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 27-36 shows an increased mean of ~222 units (vs P16-P26 avg of ~198), with volatility leading to frequent stockouts when demand exceeds 220. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 16, with a more recent uptick observed since Period 27. From Period 27 to 37, the average demand is approximately 222 units, compared to the previously observed ~200 units. The most recent demand (P37) was 196, but the preceding period (P36) was 240, indicating continued high volatility (std dev ~27). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure adequate service levels during this high-volatility, high-demand phase, I am using a recent window of 11 periods (P27-P37) to capture this latest mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This aligns the OR engine's base stock calculation with the current ~222 unit demand level while accounting for the significant variance that has caused stockouts when demand spikes above 220.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-volume regime since Period 16, with a more recent uplift noted starting around Period 27/28. The last 11 periods (P28-P38) show a mean demand of approximately 213 units, with a peak of 276. In Period 38, demand was 170 units, which is on the lower end of the recent spectrum, leaving 67 units on-hand. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To prevent stockouts during demand spikes (which have exceeded 240 units recently) while managing holding costs, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 11-period mean (~213) and use a recent_N sigma_hat to capture the current volatility. This approach ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the higher demand range observed in the current window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 28-38 confirms a mean of ~213 units, supporting the previously noted uplift. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. In the most recent window (Periods 28-39), the mean demand is approximately 213 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 30 units. While there was a temporary spike in Period 31 (276) and Period 36 (240), the last three periods (P37-P39) have seen a slight softening (196, 170, 171). However, historical data shows frequent spikes above 220 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, an order placed now arrives in time to satisfy this period's demand. I will use a recent_N of 12 (covering the Period 28-39 window) to capture the current mean and volatility while ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the high-variance nature of this SKU, minimizing stockouts without excessive holding costs. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been extremely stable at 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 16 and underwent further volatility and mean shifts. Analysis of the most recent 13 periods (P28-P40) indicates a mean demand of approximately 211.5 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of a mean around 213 units. While demand occasionally spikes above 240 (P31 at 276, P36 at 240), the recent average has settled slightly. Given lead time is consistently 0, the total pipeline must cover the upcoming period's demand. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=13) to capture the current mean of ~212 and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=13) to account for the current volatility (std dev ~31). This allows the OR engine to set a base stock that captures the 80% service level target (based on profit/holding cost ratio) while adapting to the most recent regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 28-40 confirms a mean of ~212 units with a standard deviation of ~31, confirming sustained higher volatility compared to the initial P16-P27 period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand, high-volatility regime since Period 28. The last 14 periods (P28-P41) show a mean demand of approximately 213 units with a standard deviation of 30.7. The most recent demand (P41) was 226, consistent with this confirmed uplift. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To address the persistent volatility and avoid stockouts when demand spikes above 220 units (as seen in P36 and P41), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14. This captures the current regime's characteristics while filtering out the earlier, lower-demand periods. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 28 has proven stable with a mean demand of approximately 212 units and a standard deviation of 31. Recent data from Periods 40-42 (223, 226, 219) confirms this level. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=15, which captures the entirety of the current high-demand, high-volatility regime (from P28 onwards). This provides the OR engine with the most relevant local statistics to calculate the base stock and cap.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 28-43), the mean demand is approximately 203 units with a standard deviation of about 29. While early periods showed a slightly higher mean (~212-220), the last 5 sequences reflect a slight cooling to ~203. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. To ensure the backend's base-stock calculation (which uses the critical ratio of 0.8 based on profit=$4 and holding=$1) accurately captures this sustained volume and higher volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method. Setting N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat covers the window since Period 28, effectively capturing the current regime's behavior while balancing against the inventory risk of the earlier Period 31 demand spike (276).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime beginning around Period 28. The mean demand for the most recent period (P28-P44) is approximately 205 units. While the carry-over insights earlier suggested a mean closer to 212-222, the most recent four periods (P41-P44) show demand levels of 226, 219, 176, and 208, averaging 207. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during demand spikes while managing holding costs, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=17 (covering the stable regime from P28 to P44) to capture the current mean and standard deviation. This provides the OR engine with the statistical profile of the current demand spike and volatility level.

The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-volume regime since Period 28, with a mean demand of approximately 211 units and sustained volatility (stdev ~24). The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, we are at Period 46 with 27 units on-hand. Since the promised lead time of 0 is reliable, I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=18 (covering Period 28 to 45) to capture the most relevant demand profile and volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock to handle peaks (like those >220) while minimizing excess holding costs as the game approaches its conclusion in Period 50.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 28. Analyzing the demand from Period 28 to Period 46, the mean demand is approximately 203 units with a standard deviation of about 26. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 176, 208, 204, 208, and the current state's implied demand) remains consistent with this range. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across the entire history. To maximize reward, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 19 periods (P28-P46) to capture this stable but high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock (approx 203 + z*26) to handle the frequent peaks above 220 while minimizing excess holding costs. Since lead time L=0, the target is to cover the immediate period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P28-46 confirmed stable: mean ~203, std dev ~26. Actual lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $920.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 28, with mean demand around 203 units and a standard deviation of approximately 26. In Period 47, we observed demand of 231 units, which led to a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). Given the profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure we capture the current mean and volatility while protecting against recent stockouts, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the late-game stabilized regime (P28-P47). This provides a robust estimate for the final periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $809.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter the final two periods of the horizon (P49 and P50), the primary goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory for the final period. The demand regime from P28 to P48 is stable with a mean of approximately 203 and a standard deviation around 26. Historical analysis consistently confirms a realized lead time of 0. For Period 49, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 21 samples (P28-P48) to reflect this stable regime. Since Period 50 is the final day, I am targeting a base stock that covers expected demand but avoids excessive overstocking at the buzzer. However, the OR engine's 'cap' mechanism usually prevents massive over-ordering. I will use recent_N with N=21 to capture the stabilized mean/variance.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-utility regime that began around Period 28. In the most recent block (P28-P49), the mean demand is approximately 206 units with a standard deviation of 26. Since Period 47, demand has shown slight strength (231, 208, 224), maintaining the need for robust base stock levels. Lead time is definitively confirmed at 0 periods across the entire history. I will use a recent_N of 22 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime (P28-P49) while ignoring the lower-demand early periods. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~206 plus a safety buffer for the high volatility (~26 std dev), which is critical given the low profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) which yields a target service level of 80%.
