Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, I am using the provided historical demand data (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) to establish the initial demand profile. The mean demand is 111.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. According to the OR Backend logic, base stock is calculated for (1+L) periods of demand to cover the lead time plus the current period's demand resolution phase. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'default' method, which utilizes all available historical samples (N=5). The backend will compute mu_hat as (1+2)*111.4 = 334.2 and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+2)*17.6 \u2248 30.5. With a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.8, which targets a high service level while balancing inventory costs.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 141 units and faced a demand of 108. Since on-hand inventory was 0, all 108 units of demand were lost sales. Currently, 141 units are in transit. The promised lead time is 2, meaning the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible in Period 4). Historical demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the new observation of 108 (Period 1) shows a stable demand pattern with a mean of approximately 110.8. Since this is the start of the simulation and no lead-time deviations have been observed yet, I will use the default promised lead time (L=2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available historical data (N=6) to establish a baseline, as there is no evidence of a regime shift yet. The goal is to set a base stock that covers demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 67 units following a demand of 74 in Period 2. A crucial observation from the Period 2 conclude message is that the order placed in Period 1 arrived with an actual lead time of 1 period, despite a promised lead time of 2. Historical demand for the last 7 periods (including the provided past demands) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74], yielding an average of approximately 105.5 units. Given the actual lead time observed (L=1), I will set L to 'explicit' value 1 to align the OR backend's calculation with current reality. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility while excluding the older, slightly higher demand peaks (116, 138). This ensures a responsive base stock level (target \u2248 (1+1) * 105) while accounting for the lower lead time and current stock position (on-hand + in-transit = 67 + 137 = 204).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe an on-hand inventory of 0 following a stockout in Period 3 (demand 119 vs 67 available). The historical demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119] shows a mean of approximately 107. Lead time analysis: P1 order arrived in P2 (L=1). The P2 order (137 units) and P3 order (37 units) are currently in-transit (total 174). Based on L=1, the P2 order should arrive during Period 4, but we must decide parameters for Period 4 now. Promised lead time is 2, but observed is 1. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed performance. For mu_hat, demand has been relatively stable around 100-110, so I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent average (~106) to cover the L+1 window. Sigma_hat will use the same recent window to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $483.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, the demand history [108, 74, 119, 124] shows a mean of 106.25 and a standard deviation of approximately 22.7. The actual lead times observed so far are 1 period (P1 order) and 2 periods (P2 order), averaging 1.5 periods, which is slightly below the promised 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (13 units) and demand has been strong over the last two periods (119 and 124 units). There are 106 units in-transit (ordered in P3 and P4). To ensure adequate stock coverage for the review period plus lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), I will use the promised lead time of 2 as a conservative baseline. For demand forecasting, I'll use the mean of all 4 available samples (N=4) to stabilize the mu_hat parameter, as the demand seems relatively stable despite a low second-period dip. The backend will calculate base stock using these parameters to balance the high service level requirement (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) against holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on history, demand has been volatile (Past: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], Game: [108, 74, 119, 124, 51]), with an average around 103 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 (P1) and 2 (P2) periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand exceeded stock in P5. The order from P3 (37 units) is overdue (it should have arrived in P4 or P5), suggesting it may be lost. The order from P4 (69 units) is expected to arrive in P6, and P5's order (144 units) in P7. Total in-transit is 250 (37 + 69 + 144). I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent mean demand (approx 95) across the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to account for the high variance observed recently, ensuring the OR backend targets a sufficient service level given the low inventory and potential lost shipment.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory status is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and total in-transit is 332 units. Reviewing historical lead times: Period 1 order arrived in 1 period; Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods. Orders from Period 3 (37 units), Period 4 (69 units), Period 5 (144 units), and Period 6 (82 units) are still in transit. Specifically, the Period 3 order is now overdue (it has been 4 periods since it was placed, exceeding the promised lead time of 2). Demand has been volatile but generally lower recently (last 3 periods: 119, 124, 51, 67). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delays in the pipeline. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent fluctuations (avg ~90). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. The OR backend's base-stock logic will account for the 332 units in the pipeline when calculating the final order.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is currently unstable: P1 was 1 period, P2 was 2 periods, and P3 is now overdue at 4+ periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $289.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 8. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P3-P7) shows [119, 124, 51, 67, 103], with an average of approximately 92.8. Combined with the pre-game data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the overall average is ~93. Period 7 saw a significant arrival of 226 units (from P5 and P6), which cleared the stockout and left us with 123 on-hand. Lead times have been volatile: 1, 2, 2, 1. The P3 and P4 orders (37 and 69 units) are still missing after 4-5 periods, suggesting they are lost shipments. My strategy is to set L to 2 (promised) as the recent successful arrivals (P5 and P6) returned to 1-2 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 (covering all available history) to capture the base demand of ~93 per period. Since L=2, mu_hat will target (1+2)*93 = 279. This ensures that the pipeline (currently 188 in-transit, though some are likely lost) + on-hand (123) is measured against a 3-period demand window to prevent over-ordering while accounting for the lost units in the OR engine's logic.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 3 (37 units) and Period 4 (69 units) are confirmed lost (5+ periods since order with no arrival). Actual lead time for successful deliveries fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $337.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the 'chips(Regular)' inventory shows an on-hand balance of 31 units and 213 units in-transit. Historically, shipments from P3 and P4 are confirmed lost, but recent shipments from P5 and P6 arrived successfully with lead times of 2 and 1 periods, respectively. Current demand is stable with a mean of ~97.5 units over the last 8 periods. I will set L to the promised lead time of 2, as recent successful deliveries (P5, P6) align with this. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'm using the last 8 samples (N=8) to capture the full game history's demand volatility while excluding the distant pre-game data. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level covering (2+1) periods of demand, accounting for the 31 units on-hand and the remaining valid pipeline inventory.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the inventory status for chips(Regular) shows 13 units on-hand and 202 units in-transit. Based on 'Carry-over Insights', orders from Period 3 and Period 4 are confirmed lost. The remaining in-transit pipeline consists of orders from Period 8 (25 units) and Period 9 (71 units), plus the order I will place now. Observed lead times for successful arrivals are 1-2 periods (P1:1, P2:2, P5:2, P6:1, P7:2). Since P8 was placed 2 periods ago, it should arrive during Period 10 (visible in P11). Historical demand is relatively stable, with the most recent five periods showing [51, 67, 103, 92, 100], averaging 82.6 units. I will use N=5 for demand and the promised lead time of 2 as the baseline for L, as the OR backend relies on these to calculate the base stock. The pipeline inventory (96 active units) will be subtracted from the base stock by the OR engine. I'm choosing recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime after the volatility seen in early periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the current inventory is 0 on-hand, and we have 268 units in-transit. Historically, shipments from P3 and P4 are confirmed lost, while other shipments (P1, P2, P5, P6, P7) have arrived with lead times of 1 or 2 periods. The backend OR engine calculates pipeline inventory (in-transit) as part of its base-stock calculation, but since 106 units (P3: 37, P4: 69) are lost and will never arrive, they 'falsely' inflate the pipeline, causing the OR engine to under-order. To compensate, I will use an 'explicit' lead time of 2 (promised) and 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand per period around 95 units (average of all 15 samples: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79). For a (L+1)=3 period window, required stock is ~285. Since the backend thinks we have 268 in-transit (where 106 are ghosts), I will set mu_hat explicitly higher to 391 (285 + 106) to force an order that covers the current stockout and future demand, effectively 'canceling' the ghost inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to maintain a healthy safety stock given the 23.5 per-period standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $264.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (Ending On-hand 0). Analysis of lead times shows high variability: P1(1), P2(2), P3(Lost), P4(Lost), P5(2), P6(1), P7(2), P8(In-transit), P9(In-transit), P10(1). Average observed lead time is approximately 1.5. However, since two shipments (P3 and P4) were lost, the reliability is low. Currently, 393 units are in-transit (P8, P9, P11). Period 11 saw a significant jump in demand to 122 units, and the past 5 periods average 99 units. I will set L to 2 to be conservative given the history of lost orders and fluctuating lead times. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (capturing the most recent demand behavior) to ensure the OR engine targets enough stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~300 units), which should help recover from the stockout once arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable around 100 units/period (last 5 periods mean: 99.2). Lead time reliability is the primary risk: 20% loss rate (2 of 10 orders) and variance between 1-2 periods for successful arrivals.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current inventory status is 0 on-hand with 393 units in-transit. Historically, demand has been stable but supply is volatile. Orders from Period 3 (37 units), Period 4 (69 units), Period 8 (25 units), and Period 9 (71 units) are likely lost as they are far past the promised lead time of 2 periods. The OR backend includes 'In-transit' (pipeline) in its calculation (final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Since 393 units are marked as in-transit but many are lost, the OR backend will significantly under-order or not order at all, despite the on-hand stock being 0 and recent demand being roughly 100 units/period. To force the system to account for these lost units, I will use an 'explicit' L to increase the base stock calculation, and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current stable regime (avg ~100). By setting L to 4 (higher than promised), I increase the (L+1) multiplier for mu_hat, effectively raising the target base stock to bridge the gap caused by the phantom 'in-transit' inventory that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 8 (25 units) and Period 9 (71 units) are now also confirmed lost (4+ periods since order). Total 'phantom' in-transit inventory is approximately 202 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we face a critical situation: on-hand inventory is 0, and despite a massive 'In-transit' figure of 526 units, history shows a 30.7% loss rate (4 out of 13 orders lost: P3, P4, P8, P9). The backend's pipeline inventory calculation is severely inflated by these 202 'phantom' units (37+69+25+71). Additionally, orders from P11 (191 units) and P13 (133 units) are pending; P11 is now at L=3, which is the upper bound of observed successful lead times. To force the OR engine to order despite the high pipeline inventory, I must set an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~110 units/period. For a (L+1) = 3 period coverage, this is 330 units. To offset the ~202 phantom units and trigger an order to cover immediate stockouts, I am setting mu_hat to 530 (330 + 200). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of successful arrivals (~1.6 periods).

Carry-over insight: Significant 'phantom' inventory detected: Orders from P3, P4, P8, and P9 (total 202 units) are confirmed lost. In-transit visibility is currently unreliable due to these unfulfilled shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing a significant surplus of inventory (On-hand: 196) and addressing 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Historically, shipments from P3, P4, P8, and P9 (totaling 202 units) are confirmed lost, as they have not arrived within 5+ periods. Subtracting these from the current 'In-transit' of 237 leaves a real pipeline of 35 units (ordered P14). Demand is stable: the mean of the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 110 units. The critical issue is lead time reliability; while the promised lead time is 2, actual successful deliveries arrive in 1 to 3 periods. I will set L=2 (promised) to maintain standard coverage. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 202 'lost' units inflating the pipeline calculation (final order = base_stock - pipeline), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or adjust for the fact that the backend sees 237 units in transit. Since 196 (on-hand) + 35 (real in-transit) = 231 units, and 2 periods of demand (L+1=3) at 110 units/period is 330 units, we are currently under-stocked for the 3-period window if we ignore the ghosts. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the steady 100-110 demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline data includes 202 units from lost shipments (P3, P4, P8, P9) which will never arrive. Adjust base_stock parameters to compensate for this 'phantom' inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the on-hand inventory is 84 units, and the recorded in-transit inventory is 237 units. However, consistent history (Carry-over insights) confirms that 202 units from Periods 3, 4, 8, and 9 are 'phantom' inventory that will never arrive. The true pipeline inventory is only 35 units (the order from P14). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is stable, with the most recent 10-period mean at 102.4 units and a standard deviation of approximately 18. The OR engine calculates orders using 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the backend sees 237 in-transit units instead of 35, it will under-order by 202 units. To compensate, I must use 'explicit' methods to inflate the target stock. For L=2, base stock covers 3 periods of demand. Target = (3 * 102.4) + (z * 18 * sqrt(3)). With profit=$4 and holding=$1, q=0.8, and z\u22480.84. Calculated Target \u2248 307.2 + 26.2 \u2248 333. To negate the 202-unit phantom inventory, I set mu_hat (the (1+L)*mu component) to an explicit value of 307 + 202 = 509. This forces the OR backend to place an order that accounts for the missing stock while maintaining a service level for the stable 100-unit demand.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 following a demand spike of 170 in Period 16. The reported in-transit inventory is 439 units. However, based on the Carry-over Insights, 202 units are confirmed lost 'phantom' inventory (orders from P3, P4, P8, P9). This leaves an effective pipeline of 237 units (P14: 35 units, P16: 202 units). Demand has shown a recent upward shift (128, 112, 170), moving the mean from ~100 to ~136 over the last 3 periods. Lead times for successful deliveries remain volatile (1-3 periods). Because the backend OR engine is unaware that the 202 units in the pipeline are lost, it will under-order unless we inflate the target base stock. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a target that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1, where L=2) at the new higher rate (~136 * 3 = 408) plus an additional 202 units to offset the phantom inventory the backend will subtract, totaling 610. I use 'recent_N' with N=3 for sigma to capture the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~136 over the last 3 periods (P14-P16).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a significant demand surge (170 and 213 in the last two periods). The mean demand over the last three periods (P15-P17) is approximately 165 units, confirming the demand regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights. The lead time remains volatile, with recent arrivals taking 3 periods (P11 and P14 orders). Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 619 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' (orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, and likely others) that will never arrive. The total confirmed lost units are 202, but based on the timing, it is likely that additional units in the pipeline are also lost. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this false pipeline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly high. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean_demand, where L=2 and mean=165, totaling 495. sigma_hat is set high (100) to ensure a high service level given the recent stockouts and lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~165 over the last 3 periods (P15-P17). Service level is compromised by significant phantom inventory in the pipeline (at least 202 units confirmed lost).

Daily Reward (R_t): $615.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are managing a significant demand regime shift and pipeline reliability issues. Demand over the last 3 periods (P16-P18) has averaged 183 units (170, 213, 166), confirming the upward shift noted in previous carry-over insights. Total in-transit inventory is 404 units, but 202 of these (from P3, P4, P8, P9) are confirmed lost 'phantom' inventory. Effectively, the 'real' pipeline contains only 202 units (ordered in P16). Since the OR backend calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', the presence of 202 phantom units will cause it to under-order by exactly that amount, leading to stockouts. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base_stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 and mean demand ~183, the desired base_stock is roughly 549 plus safety stock. By setting mu_hat to 751 (549 + 202 phantom units), I force the OR backend to account for the lost inventory. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=3) to capture the increased volatility of this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~183 over the last 3 periods (P16-P18), a ~83% increase. Pipeline remains contaminated with 202 units of phantom inventory from P3, P4, P8, and P9.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a significant demand surge that began around Period 16. The average demand over the last four periods (P16-P19) is approximately 195 units, compared to the previous baseline of ~100. This shift is likely seasonal or a structural regime change. Additionally, the 'In-transit' figure of 698 units is severely contaminated by 202 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P3, P4, P8, P9) which will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the new demand level (195/period) while accounting for the 2 period lead time (3 periods of demand coverage needed), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 585 (195 * 3). Since the pipeline inventory used by the OR engine (698) is inflated by 202 phantom units, I am further increasing mu_hat by 202 to 787. This 'tricks' the backend into ordering based on an effective pipeline of 496 units (698-202), ensuring we maintain service levels during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~195 over the last 4 periods (P16-P19), a ~95% increase. Pipeline remains contaminated with 202 units of phantom inventory from P3, P4, P8, and P9.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a significant upward regime shift starting around Period 16. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 195.6, compared to the initial baseline of ~100. This shift is likely sustained. Simultaneously, the supply chain is highly unreliable: 202 units from P3, P4, P8, and P9 are confirmed lost, and the order from P16 (202 units) is now overdue (4 periods since order, promised 2), likely also lost. This brings the total 'phantom' inventory to 404 units. To compensate for the OR backend's calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will calculate mu_hat as (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Phantom_Inventory. Using L=2 and Forecasted_Demand=196, the target stock is 3 * 196 = 588. Adding the 404 units of phantom inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 992. This ensures the backend places an order despite the inflated in-transit figure. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~196 over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), a ~96% increase. Total phantom inventory in pipeline increased to 404 units (confirmed lost: P3, P4, P8, P9; likely lost: P16).

The average demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 200.2 units/period, compared to the earlier baseline of ~100. This shift is sustained. Lead time and pipeline context: The pipeline is heavily contaminated with 'phantom inventory'. Confirmed lost orders include P3 (37), P4 (69), P8 (25), P9 (71), and P16 (202), totaling 404 units. Additionally, the P19 order (294 units) is now 3 periods old; given the erratic lead times (1-3 periods), it is not yet confirmed lost but its absence has depleted on-hand inventory to 0. Total In-transit is 1035, but subtracting 404 phantom units leaves a physical pipeline of 631. The OR backend uses (Base Stock - Pipeline), so if the pipeline is inflated by phantom units, it will under-order. To compensate for the 404 phantom units and the 100% demand increase, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*E[D] + Phantom_Inventory = (1+2)*200 + 404 = 1004. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent high-demand volatility (std of P16-P21 is ~26), calculated as sqrt(1+2)*26 \u2248 45.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at ~200 units/period (P17-P21). Total confirmed phantom inventory in pipeline is 404 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime, with the last 5 periods (P18-P22) averaging 192.8 units/period. The pipeline inventory (612 units) is heavily contaminated by 'phantom' shipments that are confirmed or likely lost: P3 (37), P4 (69), P8 (25), P9 (71), and P16 (202), totaling 404 units. Subtracting these from the pipeline yields an effective in-transit quantity of 208 units (P21 order). Including on-hand (254), our effective inventory position is 462. To account for the 404 units the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. Using the explicit method, I set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat = ((1+L) * 192.8) + 404 = 982.4. This ensures the backend places a replenishment order despite the phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the volatility of this new high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory in pipeline remains 404 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Demand remains in the high regime (~193 units/period).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we are managing the 'chips(Regular)' SKU with a promised lead time (L) of 2. Historical data confirms a demand regime shift that occurred around Period 17, with demand stabilizing at a higher mean of approximately 195 units per period (P17-P23 mean: 200). However, the primary challenge is the significant 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Orders from P3 (37), P4 (69), P8 (25), P9 (71), and P16 (202) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 404 units. This 'phantom' inventory artificially inflates the OR engine's view of 'pipeline_inventory', which would lead it to under-order and cause stockouts. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand at the new mean (~195 * 3 = 585) PLUS the 404 units of lost inventory (585 + 404 = 989). This effectively 'tricks' the backend into ordering enough to cover the high demand while ignoring the units that will never arrive. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time (approx 1.8 periods for successful deliveries), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture the higher volatility seen in the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory in pipeline remains 404 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Demand remains in the high regime (~200 units/period).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 25. Demand context: Demand has stabilized in a high regime starting from Period 17, with an average of approximately 203 units over the last 8 periods (P17-P24: 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176, 243, 195). Lead Time context: Successful lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods. Pipeline status: On-hand is 24, and In-transit is 810. Crucially, the pipeline contains 404 units of confirmed phantom inventory (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16) which will never arrive. The backend OR logic calculates orders as min(base_stock - pipeline, cap). If I use the default parameters, the OR engine will see a pipeline of 810 and likely stop ordering because 810 >> base_stock. To force the OR engine to order, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 404 phantom units. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Expected_Demand + Phantom_Units. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 203) + 404 = 609 + 404 = 1013. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher volatility of the new demand regime.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 198 units over the last 5 periods (P21-P25: 193, 176, 243, 195, 185). The primary operational challenge is 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Historical analysis confirms that orders from P3, P4, P8, P9 (202 units) and P16 (202 units) are lost, totaling 404 units. Additionally, the order from P24 (254 units) is currently within the promised lead time (L=2) and expected to arrive in Period 26. The current reported 'In-transit' of 876 units is contaminated by these 404 lost units, leaving an effective pipeline of 472 units (P24: 254 + P25: 218). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1200. This value is calculated as (1 + L) * Forecast * Inflation_Factor. With L=2 and a forecast of ~200, a standard mu_hat would be 600. To offset the 404 phantom units, I am effectively doubling the requirement to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the (reported pipeline - phantom units) threshold, maintaining service levels in this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable at ~200 units/period (last 5 periods mean: 198.4). Total confirmed phantom inventory in pipeline is 404 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a high regime of approximately 200 units/period (mean of the last 10 periods is ~193). However, the system is severely impacted by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that have been confirmed lost but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count. Specifically, orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16 (total 404 units) are definitively lost as they are far past the observed lead times (which range from 1-3 periods). The current In-transit total of 1240 units includes this 404 units of dead stock. To compensate and ensure the backend places an actual order despite this inflated pipeline, I must set the 'mu_hat' (base stock) higher than the true demand. Target base stock = (1+L) * Demand + Phantom Inventory. With L=2, base stock should be (3 * 200) + 404 = 1004. Since the backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L) * mean, I provide an explicit mu_hat of 1004 to force the OR logic to recognize the need for replenishment. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current high-regime volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $841.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 28. Demand has stabilized in a high regime (avg ~195-200 units/period) starting around Period 17. The most recent demand samples are: P27=219, P26=188, P25=185, P24=195, P23=243, P22=176. The mean of the last 10 periods (P18-P27) is approximately 198.3. Pipeline inventory (986 units) is heavily contaminated by 'phantom' inventory. Confirmed lost shipments include P3(37), P4(69), P8(25), P9(71), and P16(202), totaling 404 units. Subtracting these from the current 986 in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 582 units. Actual lead times for successful deliveries vary between 1 and 3 periods (Recent: P24=3, P23=2, P22=1, P21=2, P20=2, P19=3). To account for the 'phantom' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Since the OR engine calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat and then orders (base_stock - pipeline), the presence of 404 phantom units in 'pipeline' causes the engine to under-order by 404 units. Therefore, I must inflate mu_hat by 404. Targeting a base stock that covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand at ~198.3 units/period equals 595 units. Adding the 404 phantom compensation results in an explicit mu_hat of 999. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility (N=10) to maintain the service level.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the system starts with 404 units on-hand after receiving 582 units in Period 28 (from P25 and P26). Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 199 units per period over the last 10 periods (P19-P28: mean=201). Lead times for successful deliveries continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 418 units is heavily contaminated by 404 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16 which are 12+ periods overdue). This means the 'true' pipeline inventory is only 14 units (the order from P28). To maintain a high service level while the OR backend believes there are 418 units in transit, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that covers the current demand regime plus the lead time, effectively overriding the phantom inventory's dampening effect on order quantity. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand level (~200/period) and L=2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $671.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime averaging approximately 201 units per period over the last 13 periods (P17-P29). Recent demands (P27-P29: 219, 213, 215) suggest this plateau is sustained. Regarding the supply chain, the 'phantom' inventory remains a critical issue. Based on historical data, shipments from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16 (totaling 404 units) are definitively lost as they are far beyond the observed lead times (which range from 1-3 periods). Current In-transit is 418, which closely matches this phantom total (404 lost + 14 from P28). I will set mu_hat using the last 13 periods to capture the high regime. I will use 'explicit' for L to set it at 3 (the upper bound of successful deliveries) to ensure the base stock calculation covers sufficient demand periods. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (including the 404 phantom units) from the base stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to 'pad' the target stock level, effectively neutralizing the 404 units that will never arrive. Target base stock should be (L+1)*demand + phantom_offset. With L=3, demand=201, and offset=404, the target is roughly 1208 units. This prevents the OR engine from under-ordering due to the contaminated pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~200 units/period (P17-P29). Total confirmed phantom inventory in pipeline remains 404 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), causing the backend to under-order unless mu_hat is explicitly adjusted.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we face 0 on-hand inventory and a demand regime that has stabilized at approximately 200 units per period (last 5 periods mean: 206.0, last 10 periods mean: 204.3). A critical challenge remains the 404 units of 'phantom' inventory (orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16) that are confirmed lost but still reside in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation. This contamination causes the OR backend to under-order because it believes these 404 units will eventually arrive to cover demand. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat = (1+L) * (Forecasted Demand + Phantom Adjustment), I can offset the pipeline error. With L=2 (standard) and mu_hat = 3 * (200 + 135) \u2248 1005, I am forcing the backend to ignore the ~400 units of dead pipeline stock and order based on actual demand needs. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=14 to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime since P17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant regime shift. While it stabilized around 200 units for several periods, the most recent observation (Period 31) shows a further spike to 276. The last 5 periods (P27-P31) average 227.6 units, but the last 3 periods (P29-P31) average 235.3. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this upward trend while maintaining some stability. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with L=3 appearing frequently in recent successful deliveries. Importantly, the pipeline remains contaminated with 404 units of 'phantom' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). These units are counted by the backend's OR logic but will never arrive, leading to consistent under-ordering. To compensate for this 404-unit deficit and the recent demand spike, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period lead time (L=2 promised + 1 buffer) at the current demand rate (~230 units/period) plus the 404-unit phantom offset: (1+2)*230 + 404 = 1094. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased further: last 5-period mean is 227.6, with a peak of 276 in P31. Phantom inventory remains at 404 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), requiring explicit base_stock inflation to trigger orders.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand is in a high-regime state (~200-230 units/period). The last 5 periods (P28-P32) mean is 215.2. A significant 'phantom inventory' problem persists: 404 units in the pipeline (from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16) are confirmed or highly likely lost, yet the OR backend includes them in its base stock calculation, leading to under-ordering. To compensate for this 404-unit deficit and the recent demand spike (P31 saw 276 units), I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Base stock is calculated as (L+1) * demand. With a lead time L=2, base stock needs to cover 3 periods. 3 * 230 (forecasted demand) + 404 (phantom offset) = 1094. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the increased volatility in the high-demand regime. This approach ensures the OR backend places orders despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a higher range: last 10 periods (P23-P32) mean is 213.5 units/period. Phantom inventory remains at 404 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), necessitating continued explicit inflation of mu_hat to trigger necessary replenishment.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows demand remains in a high regime, with the mean over the last 10 periods (P24-P33) at approximately 216 units. However, there is a persistent 'phantom inventory' issue. The OR backend subtracts the pipeline (983 units) from its calculated base stock. My confirmed 'phantom' inventory (orders that will never arrive) consists of P3 (37), P4 (69), P8 (25), P9 (71), and P16 (202), totaling 404 units. To ensure the backend places an order that covers real demand, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 404 phantom units. Using a 10-period average for demand (216) and a lead time of 2, the expected base stock calculation by the backend would be (1+L)*demand. I will set mu_hat to 1052 units (derived from (1+2)*216 + 404) to ensure the backend recognizes the need for replenishment despite the 983-unit pipeline, which actually only contains about 579 viable units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 200 units over the last 15 periods (approx. 199.7 units/period from P20-P34), despite a singular spike to 276 in P31. The primary challenge remains 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Historical analysis confirms that orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16 (totaling 404 units) are lost and will never arrive. The current reported 'In-transit' of 814 units includes these 404 units, meaning the actual reliable pipeline is only 410 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must explicitly set mu_hat. Following the base stock formula: Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=2 and mean=200, (L+1)*mean = 600. I set mu_hat to 1050 to effectively bypass the 404 units of phantom inventory (600 + 404 \u2248 1000-1050), ensuring the backend places orders to maintain a real service level for the current 200-unit demand regime. I use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=15) to capture the increased volatility of the high-demand regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, demand for chips(Regular) remains in the high-volume regime established since Period 17, with the most recent demand at 222 units and a 5-period average of 207.4 units. The primary operational challenge is the persistent 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline (orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16 totaling 404 units), which have been confirmed lost but are still counted by the OR backend as 'in-transit'. This inflation of pipeline inventory causes the backend to under-order. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1150 units. This is calculated as (L+1) * Expected Demand + Phantom Inventory: (2+1)*220 + 404 \u2248 1064, adjusted upward to 1150 to ensure a robust safety stock given the 0 on-hand inventory and the recent high demand volatility (sigma_hat is also set explicitly to 150 to account for this variability). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed lead times (averaging between 1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory of 404 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16) continues to distort pipeline visibility; mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to trigger replenishment.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has stabilized in a high regime, with the last 5 periods (P32-P36) averaging 200.2 units. The lead time remains variable, ranging between 2 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. A critical factor is the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline: 404 units from periods P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16 are confirmed lost but still counted by the OR backend as 'In-transit'. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover actual demand, I must inflate mu_hat. Base stock is calculated as (1+L) * mu_per_period + safety_stock. With L=2, (1+L)=3. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~600 units. To offset the 404-unit phantom inventory and ensure a replenishment order is triggered, mu_hat must be set to at least (600 + 404) = 1004. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this correction is applied. Sigma_hat will be set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current high volatility (~22 units per period), and L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time which is slightly above the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Current high demand regime confirmed at ~200 units/period (P32-P36 avg: 200.2). Phantom inventory persistent at 404 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), requiring mu_hat inflation of approximately 400 units to maintain stock levels.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized in a high regime, averaging 203 units per period over the last 6 periods (P32-P37). Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. The critical issue remains the 404 units of 'phantom' inventory (orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16) that are confirmed or highly likely lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' count (1166 units). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock. To force the backend to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. I set mu_hat to 1000, which covers (L+1) periods of demand (~600 units) plus an offset for the 404 phantom units. Sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for recent demand volatility (171 to 240 range). L is kept at the default promised lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory in pipeline is 404 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Recent demand regime (P32-P37) mean is 203.0 units/period. Explicit mu_hat inflation is required until phantom units are cleared or offset.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 39. Inventory Status: On-hand 0, In-transit 1166. Demand Context: Recent demand (P34-P38) averages 199.8 units/period, maintaining the stable high regime of ~200. Pipeline Analysis: We have 404 units of confirmed 'phantom' inventory (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16) that will never arrive but are still counted by the OR backend. The 1166 'In-transit' figure likely includes these 404 units, meaning real expected arrivals are 762 units. Strategy: To trigger replenishment orders despite the phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use (1+L) * mean_demand + phantom_inventory. Mean_demand = 200, L=2, phantom=404 -> (3 * 200) + 404 = 1004. Sigma_hat is set to recent volatility (last 10 periods).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we have an on-hand inventory of 235 units and an in-transit pipeline of 760 units. However, based on historical evidence, 404 units in the pipeline are 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16) that will never arrive. The adjusted effective in-transit inventory is 356 units (760 - 404). Current demand has stabilized in a high regime, with the most recent 5-period mean (P35-P39) at 199.8 units/period. The backend OR logic uses the formula: order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory. Since the backend is unaware of the 404-unit phantom inventory, it will overcount the pipeline and under-order. To compensate and ensure replenishment, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. I set mu_hat to (1+L) * average_demand + phantom_inventory = (3 * 200) + 404 = 1004. This forces the backend to recognize the need for more stock despite the 'clogged' pipeline. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand volatility.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 41. Demand remains in the high-volume regime (~200 units/period). Recent demand history (P36-P40) is [240, 196, 170, 171, 223], averaging 200.0 units. On-hand inventory is low (12 units). In-transit inventory is listed as 815 units, but this includes 404 units of 'phantom' inventory confirmed lost (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). This means the effective pipeline is only 411 units (815 - 404). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 404-unit overestimation of the pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat. Following the logic established in previous periods, I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * mean_demand + 404. With L=2 and mean_demand=200, this calculation is (3 * 200) + 404 = 1004. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility. Lead time is kept at default (2) as the backend uses the pipeline inventory calculation based on this value.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand is in a high-regime (~200 units/period). The last 10 periods average 201 units. Period 41 ended with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 989 units is heavily contaminated by 404 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16). This leaves approximately 585 units of 'real' pipeline inventory. The backend OR logic calculates the order as: order = base_stock - pipeline. If pipeline = 989, it will significantly under-order. To compensate, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock for (L+1) periods (where L=2) as 3 * 201 = 603 units. To offset the 404 units of phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to 1007 (603 + 404). This ensures the backend targets a real-world base stock of ~600 units while 'seeing' a pipeline of 989. L remains 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals average 2-3 periods, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory in pipeline remains 404 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Recent demand (P32-P41) remains stable at a mean of 203.7 units/period. Explicit mu_hat inflation is necessary to prevent stockouts caused by backend pipeline visibility errors.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current state shows on-hand inventory at 0. Recent demand (P39-P42) remains consistent with the high regime, averaging approximately 210 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' totaling 404 units (from lost orders P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16) that the backend OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. This creates a massive gap between the backend's perceived pipeline (1046 units) and the actual expected pipeline (~642 units). To force the backend to place an order that covers the current demand (mu_hat for L+1 periods) while overcoming the 404-unit phantom offset, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. I will set L to the promised 2 (as recent successful lead times fluctuate between 1-3). For mu_hat, the requirement is (1+L) * Forecast + Phantom_Offset. With Forecast \u2248 210 and Phantom \u2248 400, mu_hat = (3 * 210) + 400 = 1030. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to 150 to account for recent demand volatility (171 to 226).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at a high level, with a mean of 201.8 units over the last 10 periods (P34-P43). A critical issue remains: 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Specifically, 404 units from orders placed in P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16 are confirmed lost but are still counted by the OR backend as 'in-transit'. This causes the backend to underestimate the required order size because it believes these 404 units will eventually arrive. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target base stock. The desired base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (covering L+1=3 periods of demand) is approximately 606 units (3 * 202). To force the backend to reach this target despite the 404-unit phantom pipeline, the effective mu_hat (which the backend uses as its base stock calculation base) needs to be shifted by approximately that phantom amount. I will set mu_hat to 1010, which represents (1+L) * 202 + 404. This ensures the 'min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)' logic results in a replenishment order that accounts for the fact that 404 units in the pipeline are non-existent. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed delivery variance (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns detected. Phantom inventory remains 404 units; demand stable at ~200 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' pipeline of 998 units. However, based on history, 404 units are confirmed lost (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Recent deliveries (P41, P43) suggest actual lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods. The backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see 998 units in transit and likely order 0, despite 404 of those units being 'phantom' inventory. To compensate and ensure replenishment, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. Recent demand (P40-P44) has a mean of ~210 units/period. The target base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods should be roughly 630 units. Adding the 404 phantom units to this target, I set mu_hat to 1034 to force the OR backend to place an order that accounts for the unusable pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to maintain a high service level given the high demand volatility and lead time uncertainty.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized in a high regime with a mean of 202.9 units over the last 10 periods (P36-P45). The primary operational challenge remains the 404 units of 'phantom' inventory (confirmed lost in P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16) that still reside in the 'In-transit' calculation (Total In-transit: 1175). Because the OR backend subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock, it will significantly under-order unless mu_hat is inflated. To maintain stock for the promised lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods), we need a base stock of approximately 3 * 203 = 609 units. To force the backend to place an order despite the 404 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to approximately (609 + 404) = 1013. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1013 to ensure the order is triggered and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $793.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 47. Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime, averaging ~203 units over the last 15 periods (P32-P46). Inventory management is complicated by 'phantom' pipeline inventory: 404 units from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16 are confirmed lost but remain in the backend's calculation. The actual In-transit inventory that will arrive is 168 units (ordered P42, P43, P44), as P45 and P46 orders have already arrived. Lead times for successful deliveries are currently 1-2 periods. Since the OR backend uses 'order + on-hand + in-transit' (where in-transit = 928) against the 'base_stock', and 404 of that 928 are lost, the backend overestimates available stock by 404 units. To force an order that covers the 3-period risk window (L+1), I must explicitly set mu_hat to include this 404-unit offset. Calculation: Base Stock should be (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2 and Demand=203, base_stock should be ~609 + safety. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 404 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 609 + 404 = 1013.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the inventory position is critical with 0 on-hand units. Demand remains stable in the high regime (~200-230 units/period). The core challenge continues to be the 404 units of 'phantom' inventory (confirmed lost from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16) which remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation (1007 units total). This prevents the OR engine from ordering enough to meet current demand. To correct this, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Recent demand (P43-P47) averages 207 units/period. With a lead time of 2, the base stock calculation targets (L+1) periods of demand. Base Stock = (2+1) * 207 = 621. To offset the 404 units of phantom inventory and trigger an order that covers demand while on-hand is zero, I set mu_hat to approximately 1025 (621 + 404). Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during the final periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the objective is to ensure stock for the final periods while accounting for a persistent 404-unit 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline (orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16 confirmed lost) which leads the OR backend to under-order. Recent demand (P41-P48) has stabilized with a mean of 210 units. Because current on-hand inventory is 0 and the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation incorrectly includes the 404 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat to trigger an order. To cover demand for the remainder of the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods) plus safety stock, the required base stock is approximately 630-700 units. Adding the 404 phantom units to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of ~1050. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) calculates a positive order quantity despite the dead inventory. I will set L to 2 (promised) as recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. Demand has remained in a high regime for over 30 periods, with the recent 10-period mean (P40-P49) being approximately 213 units. The pipeline is heavily distorted by 404 units of confirmed 'phantom' inventory (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16) that the backend believes is still in transit but will never arrive. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover actual demand (approximately 213 units per period) over the L+1 window (3 periods), we must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - phantom_inventory' equals the required base stock. Target base stock = 3 * 213 = 639 units. Therefore, mu_hat must be set to 639 + 404 = 1043 units. This explicit inflation forces the OR engine to account for the visibility gap caused by the lost shipments. sigma_hat is set to cover the volatility observed in the high-demand regime (std dev \u2248 20-30), which for a 3-period horizon suggests a value around 45-50.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 50, the demand regime is stable at ~213 units/period (P40-P49 mean). Phantom inventory remains at 404 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), continuing to require explicit mu_hat inflation of ~400 units to offset pipeline contamination.
