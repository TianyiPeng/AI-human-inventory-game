The OR recommendation of 212 units is based on long-term data. However, the system is currently at zero inventory and just experienced a stockout (sold 228 vs. 231 demand in P47). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), it is optimal to carry slight safety stock.

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "1. **Lead-Time Inference**: Based on the 'conclude' messages from Period 1 through Period 48, every order placed has arrived within the same period (lead time = 0). This confirms the promised lead time of 0 is being honored consistently.\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (Periods 40-48) shows values of 223, 226, 219, 176, 208, 204, 208, 231, and 208. The average over these 9 periods is approximately 211.5 units. The OR baseline recommendation of 186 units is based on the entire history (including the lower demand periods 1-15 where demand was ~100), which significantly underestimates the current regime (established around Period 27-32) where demand consistently exceeds 200.\n\n3. **Inventory & Strategy**: We are currently in Period 49, with Period 50 being the final period. Since lead time is 0, the order placed now will arrive and satisfy Period 49 demand. Starting on-hand is 27. To avoid stockouts given the current demand level (~210), we need total availability (On-hand + Order) to be at least 210-230. \n\n4. **Final Decision**: Setting the target availability to 230 to cover potential variance. Since we have 27 on-hand, the order should be 230 - 27 = 203. However, I will round up to 210 to ensure high service level for the penultimate period. The OR's 186 is too low because it still weighs the early, low-demand periods too heavily.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "1. Lead Time Analysis: Consistent history from Period 1 to 49 confirms a lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same execution cycle. No orders have been lost. 2. Demand Analysis: The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16 (to ~190) and again at Period 27 (to ~225). Looking at the most recent 10 periods (P40-P49), the mean demand is 212.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.7. The OR recommendation of 201 is based on the entire history (including the lower-demand periods P1-P15), which drags the baseline lower than the currently observed regime. 3. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 13 units. Since lead time is 0, the total requirements for Period 50 must be covered by (Inventory + Period 50 Order). 4. Economic Balancing: With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical fractile is 0.8. Using recent stats (\u03bc=213, \u03c3=18) and a z-score for 0.8 (~0.84), the target base stock is 213 + (0.84 * 18) = 228 units. Subtracting current inventory (13) leads to an order of 215. 5.
