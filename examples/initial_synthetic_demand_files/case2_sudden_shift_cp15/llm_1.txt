The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the sequence of events means my Period 1 order arrives in Period 5 (L=4), I need to cover demand for Periods 1 through 5 (L+1 = 5 periods) to avoid prolonged stockouts. However, the order only becomes available after the Period 5 demand phase (visible in Period 6), so covering at least 5-6 periods of demand is prudent. I will target a base inventory level to cover roughly 5 periods of average demand (5 * 111.4 \u2248 557) plus a small safety margin. Placing an initial order of 580 units to establish the pipeline.",

This demand is consistent with the historical sample average of ~111 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 6 decision phase (Period 5 conclude). Therefore, I have 4 periods of demand to cover before the first shipment arrives (Periods 2, 3, 4, 5). Total demand to cover until P5 arrival = 4 periods * ~111 units/period = 444 units. I currently have 580 units in transit. However, to maintain a continuous pipeline, I must account for the lead time gap (L+1). Since L=4, the standard order cycle is 5 periods. I need to ensure enough inventory is in the pipeline to cover demand from now until the order I place today arrives (Period 6). Total pipeline requirement \u2248 5 periods * 115 (conservative mean) + safety stock. Total required \u2248 575 + safety. Since 580 units are already in transit and expected in P5, I have enough for the immediate lead time, but I should start building a steady replenishment flow of approximately 115 units per period to avoid future stockouts.",

For 5 periods (P3 to P7), target inventory is 550. Since 695 units are already in-transit and should arrive within that window, and current on-hand is 0, the pipeline is sufficient.

  "rationale": "The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 200 units per period (recent demand P36-P43: 240, 196, 170, 171, 223, 226, 219, 176). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With the game ending at Period 50, the current order (Period 44) will arrive at the start of Period 49 (after the Period 48 conclude), meaning it only needs to cover demand for Period 49 and 50. Total pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) is 113 + 840 = 953 units. Expected arrivals over the next periods are: P44 (P40 order: 210), P45 (P41 order: 210), P46 (P42 order: 210), P47 (P43 order: 210). This fulfills the remaining 7 periods of demand (7 * 210 = 1470) only partially, but the game is nearing its end. Specifically, the units available for the remaining 7 periods (P44-P50) should cover ~1400-1470 units. Current pipeline is 953. I need to order to ensure the periods P49 and P50 are covered. Forecast for P44-P50 (7 periods) at 210/period is 1470. 1470 - 953 = 517. However, an order placed now (P44) arrives in P48's resolution, becoming visible in P49. So the P44 order covers demand for P49 and P50. Total demand to cover from now until P50 is 7 * 210 = 1470. Pipeline is 953. I will order 210 to maintain the flow, though total pipeline will still be slightly under the total 7-period demand; since holding costs are $1 and profit is $4, it's safer to maintain a steady arrival than to overstock at the very end.",

Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 198.3, confirming the stability of this higher regime. Period 44 demand was 208. (c) Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Orders from Periods 37, 38, 39, and 40 have arrived on schedule. (d) Inventory & Pipeline assessment: Current on-hand is 115. In-transit consists of orders from P41 (210), P42 (210), P43 (210), and P44 (210), totaling 840. Total system inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 955. (e) Target Inventory calculation: To cover demand for the lead time plus the decision period (L+1 = 5 periods) at a rate of ~200/period, I need roughly 1000 units. Current pipeline is 955. Ordering 210 units maintains the flow to cover the 200/period demand while building a small safety buffer as we approach the end of the game (Period 50). Note: The game ends at Period 50, so any order placed today (Period 45) will arrive in Period 49 and be sold in Periods 49 and 50. Total remaining demand is approx 6 * 200 = 1200.",

With only 5 periods remaining in the game (Periods 46-50), the order planning must prioritize meeting demand for the duration of the lead time while avoiding excessive leftover inventory at Period 50. Total Pipeline (On-hand 121 + In-transit 840) = 961 units. Total expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (Period 46 to 50) at a rate of 205/period is approx 1,025 units. The current pipeline (961) almost covers this, but we need to ensure against the upper bound of demand (approx 230/period) and account for the fact that orders placed now will arrive in Period 50 (last period). Therefore, an order is needed to bridge the gap between current coverage (961) and total remaining demand (5 * 205 = 1025). Ordering 100 units ensures sufficient stock for the final periods without creating a massive surplus, as we are entering the end-game phase.",

The order from P47 was 0. Total projected availability is: Period 48: 102 (on-hand) + 210 (arrival) = 312 units. Period 49: (312 - ~200 demand) + 210 (arrival) = ~322 units.
