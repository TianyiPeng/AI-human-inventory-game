The average of these samples is 111.4 units per period. The product is a staple snack (Regular Chips), typically exhibiting stable demand unless a calendar event or marketing shift occurs. Since the promised lead time is 0, orders placed now should arrive during this period and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. To maximize reward, I must cover the expected demand for Period 1 while avoiding excessive holding costs. Given the initial on-hand inventory is 0 and the average demand is ~111, I will order 120 units to provide a small buffer for the variation seen in the samples (max was 138, min was 94).",
