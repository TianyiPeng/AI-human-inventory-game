Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The past demand history provided (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) indicates a mean demand of approximately 111.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no on-hand inventory or units in-transit, we need to establish a base stock level that covers demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the 'default' method for L (which uses the promised lead time of 4) and the 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to calculate the initial order based on all available historical demand data. This provides a statistically sound starting point for the first decision cycle.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 141 units was placed, but with a promised lead time of 4 periods, it is correctly reflected as 'In-transit' and will not arrive until Period 5 (concluding in Period 6). Current on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 as demand (108) exceeded on-hand stock. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (including the most recent observation) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108], showing relatively stable behavior with a mean around 110. Since we have very few observations and no confirmed lead time deviations yet, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand parameters to capture the full available history while remaining responsive to the current stable regime. The goal is to build up inventory to cover the 5-period cycle (L+1).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for \u2018chips(Regular)\u2019 has been [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [108, 74] (Periods 1-2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 278 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 1 and 2). The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order from Period 1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). We are currently experiencing lost sales because on-hand inventory started at 0. Since there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods, I will use 'default' for L. For demand estimation (mu_hat), the mean of all available samples (including history) is approximately 105. Since the last two periods (108, 74) show some volatility but no clear regime shift yet, I will use 'default' to incorporate all data points, which helps stabilize the base stock calculation during this initial stock-out phase.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 417 units) are in-transit. None have arrived yet because the earliest arrival (from Period 1) is expected during Period 5's arrival resolution (visible in Period 5 conclude, read at P6). Demand history shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-start) and recently [108, 74, 119] for Periods 1-3. The average demand across these 8 samples is approximately 107 units. Total lost sales are significant due to starting with 0 inventory and 4-period lead time. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (the full available history) to stabilize the base stock calculation around this mean demand while we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, P3, and P4 are currently in-transit (141+137+139+139 = 556 units). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during the Period 5 arrival resolution phase. Since this happens after my current decision, I still see 0 on-hand. There is no evidence yet that the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods, as we must wait for the 'Period 5 conclude' message to confirm the P1 arrival. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and during the game [108, 74, 119, 124]. The mean demand is approximately 109 units per period. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=9 (all available samples) to capture the base stock requirement for (L+1) = 5 periods. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level of roughly 5 * 109 units plus a safety factor, minus the 556 units already in the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the Period 1 order arriving at the end of Period 5 (141 units). The demand history shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-start) and [108, 74, 119, 124, 51] during periods 1-5. There is a noticeable drop in demand in Period 5 (51 units), but it's too early to confirm a regime shift. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture recent trends while maintaining stability. Current on-hand is 90 and in-transit is 440 (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), totaling 530 units of pipeline inventory. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. The average demand over the last 5 periods (~95) suggests we need ~475 units to satisfy demand through the lead time. The OR backend will calculate the final order based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Based on the conclude message for Period 6, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6), matching the promised lead time. Current inventory is 160 on-hand with 309 in transit. Examining demand history: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67]. There is a noticeable drop in demand starting around Period 5 (demand dropped from an avg of ~115 to ~59 in the last two periods). To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for potential recovery, I will use a recent_N window of 6 to capture the recent trend without being overly reactive to the very last two low samples. L is set to default (4). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 6 periods of data to reflect the recent demand variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game data) was high [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124], averaging ~109 units. However, in the last 3 concluded periods (P5-P7), demand has dropped significantly to [51, 67, 103], averaging ~73.6 units. This suggests a potential regime shift or seasonal dip. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on P1, P2, and P3 arrivals. Currently, we have 196 units on hand and 211 in transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using modern demand (average 74) for mu_hat calculations helps avoid overstocking while our on-hand inventory is high. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent lower demand trend and keep L at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 5: Average demand decreased from ~110 to ~74 (-33%) over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of the game history confirms the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Regarding demand, we observed a significant shift starting around Period 5. The initial 5 samples (including pre-game) averaged ~111, while the last 4 periods (P5-P8) have averaged 78.25 (51, 67, 103, 92). Although Period 7 and 8 saw a slight rebound, the overall mean is lower than the start. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. With On-hand inventory at 243 and 84 units in-transit (orders from P5-P8), our pipeline is sufficient, but we must update the forecast to prevent overstocking given the holding cost of $1.0 vs profit of $4.0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 5-8 average demand is 78.25, compared to initial average of ~111.

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals from Period 1 through Period 5 (arriving P5-P9). Demand appears to have shifted starting from Period 5. While the initial five periods (including pre-game history) averaged 111.4 items, the last five periods (P5-P9) have an average of 82.6 units (51, 67, 103, 92, 100). The last three periods specifically (P7-P9) show a slight upward trend within this new regime (average 98.3), suggesting the initial 'drop' at P5 may have been an outlier or a temporary dip. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this newer, lower demand regime (avg ~83) while providing enough safety spread. With on-hand inventory at 168 and in-transit at 168, the current pipeline is 336. A base stock target for L=4 (covering 5 periods) at ~83/period would be around 415, so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in periods 5 through 10). Demand has shown a shift since Period 5. The initial mean was approximately 106.25 (P1-P4: 108, 74, 119, 124), but excluding those early values, the demand from Period 5 to 10 has averaged 82.0 (51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79). While earlier insights noted a larger drop, the last four periods (P7-P10) have stabilized with a mean around 93.5 and moderate volatility. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target pipeline covers (L+1)=5 periods. Currently, on-hand is 95 and in-transit is 282, totaling 377 units. This covers roughly 4 periods of demand at the recent average of 93.5. To allow the OR backend to adjust to the current demand level, I will use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime since P5, while keeping L as default since the promised and actual lead times match.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-11 matching orders from Periods 1-7). Current inventory is low (14 units on-hand), but a significant amount is in-transit (313 units), including the order from Period 8 (12 units) which is expected to arrive during this period (Period 12). Demand has shown a regime shift; initially averaging ~113 units in Periods 1-4, it dropped and then normalized. Analysis of the most recent 7 periods (P5-P11) shows an average demand of 87.7 units with a standard deviation of ~24.4. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this stabilized demand regime (87.7 * 5 = 438.5) while allowing for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Periods 5-11 average demand is 87.7 units, reflecting a moderate recovery from the initial post-shift low in Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we completed the sell-through of all on-hand inventory (starting 26, demand 119, ended at 0). The actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. Since Period 5, demand has been in a new regime. Calculating the average demand from Period 5 to 12 (51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79, 122, 119) gives an average of 91.625 units per period. This represents a recovery from the low observed in Periods 5-8. To respond to this upward trend within the current regime while maintaining adequate safety stock to avoid further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this specific regime. With a lead time of 4, the OR engine needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current pipeline inventory is 429 units (orders from P9-P12), and an arrival of 109 units (ordered P9) is expected during Period 13 resolution, which will help satisfy the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5-12 has stabilized at an average of 91.6 units, showing a recovery trend from the initial post-shift drop.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a shift around Period 5. While the initial periods (P1-P4) averaged ~106 units, demand from Period 5 to 13 has averaged approximately 92.9 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P9-P13) show a mean of 104.4, indicating demand is recovering toward the original baseline. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this recent recovery while discounting the deep trough seen in Period 5. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect recent volatility. The lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals, so I will continue using the default promised lead time. Currently, 396 units are in transit and 7 on-hand; this high pipeline is due to small orders placed in P5-P8 arriving now while larger orders placed in P9-P12 are still in transit. The OR backend needs to maintain coverage for L+1 (5) periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Periods 9-13 average 104.4 units, returning toward the pre-Period 5 baseline of ~106.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an inventory shortage with 0 on-hand units after stockouts in Period 12 and Period 14. Demand has fully recovered from the Period 5-8 dip; the last 5 periods (P10-P14) show an average demand of 110.0 units, aligning with pre-shift levels. The lead time is stable at 4 periods as consistently observed from P5 through P14. Although there are 409 units in-transit (orders from P11: 72, P12: 128, P13: 76, P14: 133), the arrival sequence means we will only receive the P11 order (72 units) during Period 15, which might be insufficient to cover the current demand (average ~110). To ensure we return to optimal base stock levels and account for the recovered demand profile, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and setting L to default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery complete: Periods 10-14 average demand is 110.0, matching the baseline established in Periods 1-4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has fully recovered to its baseline level. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P10-P15) is 108.8 units, matching the initial pre-shift baseline of ~106-110 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there have been stockouts in Periods 12, 14, and 15 due to low arrival quantities from orders placed during the brief demand dip (Periods 5-8). However, there are 480 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15), which should soon stabilize the inventory position. To ensure the OR backend captures this recovered demand level, I am using recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $512.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we have 0 units on-hand and 458 units in-transit. The previous period (16) saw a significant demand spike to 170, the highest observed yet, following a complete demand recovery to the baseline levels (~110). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Periods 12, 14, 15, and 16 all ended with zero inventory and lost sales (sold < demand), the system is under-stocked. To address the demand spike and replenish the stock-out state, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covering Periods 12-16) to capture the current high-demand regime. This N choice captures the recovery and the recent spike, providing a more responsive mu_hat than the total history average. This should increase the base stock calculation in the OR backend to better meet the recovered and potentially growing demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected at Period 16 (170 units); 5-period average (P12-P16) is 126.2, significantly higher than the previous baseline of 110.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has escalated significantly over the last two periods (P16: 170, P17: 213), confirming a strong upward trend or seasonal spike. The 5-period average (P13-P17) is now 145 units, well above the previous 110 baseline. With on-hand inventory currently at 0 and multiple periods of stockouts (P14-P17), there is an urgent need to increase the safety stock. The pipeline inventory is high (552 units), reflecting large recent orders (P14: 133, P15: 143, P16: 106, P17: 170) which are expected to arrive in P18-P21 given the stable 4-period lead time. To address the new demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (reflecting the jump from ~100 to ~213) to ensure the OR backend aims for a higher base stock. Sigma_hat is also calculated over these 5 periods to capture the increased volatility (std dev has risen with the mean). Lead time remains 'default' at the promised 4 periods as evidence remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike sustained and increasing: P16-P17 average is 191.5; 5-period average (P13-P17) risen to 145.0 units (+32% vs baseline).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, demand was around 110 units (Periods 1-4 and 10-14), but shifted upward starting in Period 16. The most recent demand samples are 170, 213, and 166 (average 183.0). I will use N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime, as using a longer window would underestimate current needs and lead to stockouts, which have occurred in the last five consecutive periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 640 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (Period 18 showing Period 14 arrival).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed: Period 16-18 average demand is 183.0 units (+66% vs baseline of 110). Sustained stockouts since Period 14 due to demand spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $572.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. The average demand over the last four periods (P16-P19) is 195.0 units (170, 213, 166, 231). This is a significant increase from the previous baseline of 110. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. Since Period 14, we have experienced consistent stockouts as demand has outpaced arrivals, which were based on lower previous order quantities. To recover service levels and prevent further lost sales during this peak, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new elevated regime. N=4 is chosen because it perfectly aligns with the onset of the current high-demand spike (Period 16 to Period 19). The OR backend will use these values to inflate the base stock level (L+1 demand) to meet the new demand reality while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained: Period 16-19 average demand is 195.0 units (+77% vs baseline of 110). Inventory remains at zero with continuous stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime starting around Period 16. The average demand over the last five periods (P16-P20) is 195.6 units, which is nearly double the initial baseline of ~110. This surge has resulted in continuous stockouts since Period 14, as inventory arrivals (based on orders placed before the surge) are insufficient to meet the new demand levels. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (P16 order arrived in P20). To capture this sustained high demand and recover stock levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level (L+1 periods) that accounts for the current 195+ unit demand environment. The large in-transit balance (865 units) reflects the aggressive ordering in recent periods (P17-P20) to catch up with this spike, which should reach the warehouse starting next period (P21 resolution).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Period 16-20 average demand is 195.6 units (+78% vs baseline of 110). Stockouts have persisted for 7 consecutive periods due to this unpredicted surge.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 6 periods (P16-P21), the average demand is 195.17 units (170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193). This represents a sustained increase of approximately 77% compared to the earlier baseline of 110. Although several orders have arrived recently, demand continues to exceed on-hand inventory, resulting in a series of stockouts and zero ending inventory for the past ten periods. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 21. To capture the current high-demand state while ignoring the lower historical data before the shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window of 6. This period, the backend will attempt to recover the inventory position based on a target pipeline of (1+L)*mu_hat, adjusted by the 861 units currently in-transit.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (avg ~195 units) confirmed as sustained over 6 periods (P16-P21) with consistent stockouts.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the last seven periods (P16-P22), demand has averaged 191.4 units (samples: 170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176). Period 22 finally saw ending inventory (45 units) for the first time since Period 13, thanks to the arrival of 221 units ordered in Period 18. This confirms the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is currently 802 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the new regime average. To maintain a high service level given the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 7-period regime (N=7). L will remain at the promised/confirmed 4 periods. Sigma_hat will also be calculated based on the recent N=7 periods to capture the volatility of this high-demand phase, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current environment rather than the historical average.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed: Period 16-22 average demand is 191.4 units (~74% higher than the baseline 110). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 16 to Period 23) has stabilized at a high average of approximately 198.8 units (demands: 170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176, 243). This is significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~110. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 28 units with significant in-transit orders finally arriving (Period 22 and 23 arrivals have started to clear the stockout situation). For Period 24, mu_hat is set to cover (1+L) = 5 periods using the most recent 8 samples to capture this new high-demand state (N=8). sigma_hat is also adjusted based on this recent high-volatility regime to maintain service levels while accounting for the increased demand variance.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (avg ~199 units) confirmed sustained for 8 periods (P16-P23), correcting from previous baseline of 110.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high demand regime (Period 16 onwards) is well-established, with an average demand of approximately 199.1 units over the last 9 periods (P16-P24). Inventory has finally begun to recover from the stockout phase following the arrival of larger orders from Periods 18-20. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on history. I am setting L to the prometed 4. To accurately capture the current high demand level and volatility, I am using recent_N (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which focuses on the period since the demand shift started in Period 16. This should maintain enough safety stock to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs as inventory replenishes.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16-P24) average demand stabilized at 199.1 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is approximately 197.9 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline of 110. The on-hand inventory is currently 62 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 795 units. Lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods. Since the demand has stabilized at this new level without further shifting for 10 periods, I will use recent_N with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the high-demand regime specifically while ignoring the lower historical data from before Period 16. Setting L to default (4) as lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 16-25 average demand is 197.9 units, reflecting a permanent shift from the original baseline (~110). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. The average demand for the last 11 periods (P16-P26) is approximately 196.3 units, which is significantly higher than the original baseline of ~110. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrival data (P22 order arrived in P26). Because the demand has been stable within this new regime for 11 periods, I am using recent_N with N=11 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) period cycle (5 periods of demand) while the backend's capped policy will manage order sizes against current inventory and pipeline. On-hand inventory is 36, and the pipeline is healthy (809 units in-transit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 16-26 average demand is 196.3 units, confirming a sustained shift from original baseline (~110).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-regime phase starting around Period 16. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the mean demand is approximately 198 units per period, consistently higher than the original baseline of ~110. The most recent demand (P27) was 219, resulting in a stockout. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. To ensure adequate coverage for the review plus lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), mu_hat is set using the recent N method with N=12 to capture this high-demand regime while smoothing recent volatility. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the same 12-period window to accurately reflect current demand variance. The OR backend's inventory calculation will account for the 830 units in-transit (orders from P24-P27) and the zero on-hand balance.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16 and has stabilized at a new, higher baseline. Over the last 13 periods (P16-P28), demand has averaged approximately 197.8 units, compared to the original baseline of ~110. The most recent 5 periods (P24-P28) show an average demand of 199.0 units, indicating continued stability at this higher level. Lead time consistency is well-established at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in P20, P21, P22, P23, and P24). The inventory position is currently low (33 on-hand) with a large pipeline (790 in-transit) intended to meet this higher demand regime. I will use N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of this stabilized high-demand period while excluding the previous lower-demand regime. The lead time L is set to calculated as it has been consistently 4 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16 from a baseline of ~110 to a higher level. Over the last 10 periods (P20-P29), the average demand is approximately 202.5 units (198, 193, 176, 243, 195, 185, 188, 219, 213, 215). The last 3-5 periods have stabilized around this ~200-215 range. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple historical arrivals (e.g., P25 arrival was ordered P21). I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this higher stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, which will set the base stock to cover expected demand over the lead time plus current period (L+1=5). This approach helps maintain a high service level for this high-margin (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) product while preventing stockouts observed in earlier periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~202 units over the last 10 periods (P20-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 16, with the average demand over the last 10 periods (P21-P30) being approximately 201.2 units. This aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 30 stating demand is stable at ~202. The lead time has remained exceptionally consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5. The on-hand inventory is currently low (5 units), but there is a significant amount in-transit (830 units) which covers expected demand over the next 4 periods (approx 805 units). To maintain this stable state and provide sufficient safety stock for the backend OR engine, I will use a recent_N window of 11 periods to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the transition phase. This ensures mu_hat is based on the current mean (~202) and sigma_hat accounts for the observed volatility in this stable period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $748.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 16 and has stabilized at a much higher level. Over the last 10 periods (P22-P31), the average demand is approximately 220.3 units (176, 243, 195, 185, 188, 219, 213, 215, 215, 276). Period 31 saw a notable spike to 276 units, leading to a stockout as on-hand inventory was insufficient. Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all historical data. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture this higher mean, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this elevated demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the increased volatility observed in this high-demand regime, particularly with the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher mean: P22-P31 average is approx 220 units (+100% vs original baseline of 110). Recent demand (P31) shows increased volatility with a spike to 276 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a higher-mean state compared to its historical origin. A significant shift occurred around Period 16, with demand increasing from ~110 to ~195, and a further upward trend observed more recently. Over the last 11 periods (P22-P32), the average demand is 219 units, compared to the 196 average of the previous stable period (P16-P26). Recent volatility is high, with demand hitting 276 in P31. The lead time has remained extremely stable at 4 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is low (20), but the pipeline is substantial (913), representing about 4.1 periods of expected demand. To maintain service levels given recent spikes and the calculated average, I am setting mu_hat using the last 11 periods of history (N=11) to capture the current high-demand mean of 219 per period (scaled by 1+L). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=11) to account for the increased volatility observed in this higher regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher mean: P22-P32 average is 219.0 units, up from the previous high-regime average of ~196.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent period (P33), we see a demand of 182, following a spike to 276 in P31 and 186 in P32. The average demand from Period 22 to 33 is approximately 201 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 56, with a large in-transit pipeline (868). Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the current high-demand regime (starting Period 22) while accounting for the recent increase in volatility. This will direct the OR engine to set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~200 units per period while being robust against the observed spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P22-P33 has stabilized at an average of 201 units, maintaining the high-demand state compared to the original baseline.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, following several shifts. Recent historical data (P22-P34) shows an average demand of approximately 201 units. In the most recent periods (P32-P34), demand has been 186, 182, and 171 respectively, indicating a slight softening from the peak of 276 in P31, but remaining consistently high compared to the original baseline of ~110. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P30-P34). Given the current on-hand inventory of 109 and a significant pipeline (in-transit) of 814 units, we must ensure the backend OR parameters don't over-order while maintaining coverage for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering the stable high-demand period P22-P34) to estimate mean demand and volatility. This helps the OR backend balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost, targeting a service level of approximately 80% (q = 4/(4+1)).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 22. Over the last 14 periods (P22-P35), the average demand is 200.7 units. Although Period 31 saw a spike to 276, recent demand (P32-P35) has been 186, 182, 171, and 222 (average 190.25). The Lead Time (L) remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from P27-P31 occurring exactly 4 periods later. The system currently has 107 units on-hand and 752 units in-transit. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=14 to reflect the stabilized high-demand regime that began in Period 22, as this provides a robust estimate of the current mean (~200 units) while accounting for the recent slight variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 22 to 35 has stabilized at an average of 200.7 units, representing a sustained high-demand state compared to the initial baseline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level than the initial baseline. The average demand from Period 22 to 36 is approximately 203.5 units, which is consistent with recent updates. Period 36 specifically saw a demand of 240 units, indicating continued strength and some volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P28 through P32). On-hand inventory is currently 118 with 728 units in-transit, which covers the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). To maintain this balance and ensure high service levels while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 15 periods (since P22) where demand stabilized in this high-growth regime. This period (N=15) captures the current mean and the volatility seen in recent spikes (e.g., P31, P36).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 22 to 36 has stabilized at an average of 203.5 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a higher level than the initial baseline. From Period 22 to Period 37, the average demand is approximately 203.5 units. Recent demand (P33-P37) has averaged 182, 171, 222, 240, 196 (avg = 202.2), confirming this stability. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (P33 order arrived P37). The inventory position is currently healthy with 95 units on hand and a large pipeline of 807 units. To maintain the service level while accounting for the recent high-demand regime, I will use a 15-period lookback window (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher volume and volatility without being overly influenced by the pre-shift baseline. This covers the period from P23 to P37.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent stable period from Period 22 to Period 38, the mean demand is approximately 201.8 units. Although there was a brief spike in Period 31 (276 units), the overall trend over the last 15+ periods has centered around 200 units. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in periods 35-38). On-hand inventory is currently 95 units with a healthy pipeline of 837 units. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering the stable high-demand period from P22-P38) will allow the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock for this regime while accounting for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 22 to 38 has stabilized at an average of 201.8 units, maintaining the high-demand state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $602.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been categorized by a high-demand state since Period 16, with a more stable sub-regime observed from Period 22 onwards. The average demand from Period 22 to 39 is approximately 201.7 units. Recent demand in Period 39 (171 units) is slightly below this average but remains consistent with the high-regime fluctuations. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. My calculation for mu_hat uses the average of the last 18 periods (N=18) to capture this stable high-demand regime, and sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to reflect current volatility. On-hand inventory is 82, and in-transit inventory is high (829 units), which covers the pipeline for the 4-period lead time against a demand of ~202 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 22 to 39 has stabilized at an average of 201.7 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-demand regime since Period 22, with the average demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) being approximately 201.7 units. The most recent demand in Period 40 was 223 units, slightly above this mean. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 86 units, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 764 units, which is quite high compared to the 1000-unit target derived from (L+1)*mean (5 * 201 = 1005). Given we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 41 of 50), I will maintain the current demand estimation parameters. I will use recent_N with N=19 (representing the stable regime from Period 22 onwards) to capture the current mean and variance accurately. This ensures we maintain a sufficient base stock to meet demand (around 200 units/period) while accounting for moderate volatility (sigma), balancing service level against the $1.0 holding cost.

With an on-hand inventory of 112 and a healthy in-transit pipeline of 739 units (covering roughly 3.6 periods of average demand), the current ordering strategy is maintaining a steady stock level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture this stable high-demand regime, ensuring the service level stays high while managing holding costs.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a higher level than the initial baseline. From Period 22 to 42, the average demand is approximately 204 units. Most recently, from Period 35 to 42, the average is 204.9 units with moderate volatility (standard deviation ~28). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 93 units on-hand and 770 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42), we are well-positioned for upcoming arrivals. For Period 43, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 21 periods (P22-P42) to capture the current high-demand regime while including enough samples to stabilize the standard deviation calculation. This ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 22 to 42 has stabilized at an average of 204.0 units, significantly higher than the original baseline of 110. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 22, with an average of approximately 204 units. Recent demand (P40-P43) shows a slight cooling (avg ~198.5) but remains significantly above the original baseline. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history (e.g., P39 order arrived in P43). Given the current on-hand inventory of 67 and a healthy pipeline of 841 units (covering approximately 4.1 periods of demand), I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent stabilized regime to maintain adequate stock levels without over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (Period 50). I use N=22 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full extent of this high-demand regime starting from its stabilization point (Period 22-43).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 22. Since Period 22, the average demand is approximately 204.0 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline of 110. Recent demand (P40-P44) has been [223, 226, 219, 176, 208], averaging 210.4 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent and verified by historical arrivals (e.g., P40 order arrived in P44). With on-hand inventory at 21 and 848 units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=23 (covering the start of the current stable high-demand regime from P22 to P44) to capture the current mean while smoothing volatility. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=23 to account for the variance in this specific regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent the stockouts observed during earlier demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 22 to 44 has stabilized at an average of 204.2 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $772.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable around a mean of ~204 units since Period 22. In the most recent periods (P41-P45), demand has averaged 206.2 units with moderate volatility. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. Currently, on-hand inventory is 44 units and there are 829 units in-transit. With 5 periods remaining in the simulation, it is crucial to avoid over-ordering as the game ends at Period 50. Orders placed now (P46) will arrive in P50 (L=4). To set the base stock level, I will use the recent_N method (N=10) to capture the current stable high-demand regime. This ensures \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 reflect the ~204 mean and recent variance, providing a 4-period lead time buffer plus the current period's demand (L+1 = 5 periods total).

Daily Reward (R_t): $765.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 22. From Period 22 to the most recent period (P46), the average demand is approximately 203.8 units per period. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all observed arrivals. The current status shows 67 units on-hand and 788 units in-transit (orders from P43, P44, P45, and P46). Given we are at Period 47 out of 50, the remaining demand exposure is limited. To set OR parameters, I will use a recent window of 20 periods (N=20) to capture the stable high-demand regime (approx. P27-P46), which reflects the current mean and volatility accurately. This balances the profit margin ($4) against the holding cost ($1) by maintaining a base stock attuned to the high-demand state while accounting for the stable 4-period lead time.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since approximately Period 22. Assessing the most recent 10 periods (P38-P47), the average demand is 201.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, which I will continue to use. Given we are at Period 48 of a 50-period game, the OR backend's inventory calculation needs to account for the actual pipeline and on-hand inventory to prevent over-ordering in the final cycles, although the base-stock logic naturally handles this. I will use the last 10 periods to parameterize both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this stabilized high-demand regime while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 22. In the most recent 10-period window (Periods 39-48), the average demand is 202.4 units, which is consistent with the long-term high-regime average of approximately 201-204 units noted in previous carry-over insights. Recent historical data shows steady volatility. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. For Period 49, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture this stable high-demand regime while excluding older, lower-demand data points. L is set to 'calculate' to continue using the observed stable lead time of 4. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption patterns and maintains a sufficient service level for the final periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $894.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 22. Over the last 10 periods (P40-P49), the average demand is 211.5 units, which is consistent with the levels observed throughout the latter half of the game. Lead time has been remarkably stable at exactly 4 periods for the entire history. Currently, the system has 2 units on-hand and 843 units in-transit. The OR backend will use the recent 10 periods of demand data (N=10) to calculate the base stock level, which covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1 = 5 periods). A 10-period window is selected to capture the current mean (~211) and the observed volatility (standard deviation ~16) while excluding older, lower-demand regimes. This strategy ensures sufficiently high service levels while minimizing excessive holding costs given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~212 units over the period range P40-P49 (last 10 periods), representing a continued sustained high-demand state.
