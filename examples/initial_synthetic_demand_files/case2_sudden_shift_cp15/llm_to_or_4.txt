Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical observation of arrival behavior or demand fluctuations beyond the seed data. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a modest profit margin. Seed demand data: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], mean \u2248 111.4, std \u2248 17.5. Since the promised lead time is 0, the OR backend expects same-period arrival. Given the starting inventory of 0, it is critical to order immediately to satisfy current period demand (which occurs after the decision). I will use the 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the available historical samples and 'default' for L to align with the promised 0-period lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 127 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived immediately, resulting in 127 units available. Demand was 108, leaving 19 units on hand. Past demand data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the most recent demand of 108 gives a mean of approximately 111. Given the promised lead time (L=0) was met, I will continue using L=0. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent demand stability while the system stabilizes. No significant demand shift is yet detected to warrant an explicit forecast or EWMA.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For the 'chips(Regular)' SKU, we have observed two completed business periods. In Period 1, 108 units were demanded, and in Period 2, 74 units were demanded. Including historical data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the total observed demand sequence is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74]. The average demand is approximately 105.5. The promised lead time is 0, and the actual lead time observed in both P1 and P2 was indeed 0 periods (same-day arrival). The current on-hand inventory is 52. The OR backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z * sigma_hat. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (all available data) allows the system to capture the baseline mean. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle volatility based on the standard deviation of these samples. This setup ensures we maintain enough stock to cover the 0-period lead time demand plus the current period's demand (Review + Lead = 1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown some stability but significant range (74 to 119 in the recorded periods). The past 5 samples (including those provided in the header) are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], while the game history for Periods 1-3 shows [108, 74, 119]. Calculating the mean of all available history (approx 107) and the standard deviation provides a baseline. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), which matches the promised lead time. I will use the default methods for lead time and sigma, but use recent_N for the demand mean to capture the most recent behavior specifically from the game environment (last 3 periods of game history + 2 priors = 5). This helps maintain a base stock level that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent historical demand for Period 1-4 was [108, 74, 119, 124], and adding the pre-game history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the overall mean is approximately 109 units. In Period 4, demand (124) exceeded available inventory (123), resulting in 1 unit of lost sales. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments from P1-P4 have arrived with an actual lead time of 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. Therefore, the order calculation needs to cover Period 5's demand entirely. Using 'default' methods will appropriately leverage the available history for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8, which signals the OR engine to target a service level corresponding to the 80th percentile of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on the historical data (Periods 1-5), the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand has shown significant volatility, ranging from 51 to 124 units. The most recent demand (Period 5) was unusually low (51), whereas previous periods were higher. Considering the full history including pre-game samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and game history [108, 74, 119, 124, 51], there is no sustained regime shift yet, just high variance. We have 74 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. I will use the default method for lead time since the promised L=0 is being met. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available recent samples (N=10 including the 5 pre-game samples) to capture the variance and mean demand accurately, as recent demand hasn't settled into a new stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $210.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data (Periods 1-6) confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability: recent samples (total available including game history) are 112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67. The last five periods (Periods 2-6) show a lower mean (87) compared to the initial past samples. However, there is no clear sustained regime shift yet, just significant variance. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pick up the recent drop in demand mean and the associated volatility, while keeping L at the default 0 to leverage same-period delivery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data (Periods 1-7) confirms an actual lead time of 0. Inventory management for Period 8 reveals 12 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Historical demand shows significant variation (ranging from 51 to 124). Demand statistics: mean \u2248 92.2, standard deviation \u2248 27.8. Given the lead time is 0, the base stock calculation must cover the current period's demand (L+1=1). Profit is $4 and Holding Cost is $1, leading to a critical ratio of 0.8, which targets a moderately high service level. The demand does not show a clear regime shift or strong seasonality yet (samples: 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103), though it has been volatile. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 (all available historical game data) to capture this volatility while ensuring the OR engine computes \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on actual realized demand performance.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for periods 1-8 confirms an actual lead time of 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has fluctuated but lacks a clear seasonal trend or regime shift within this small sample. Historical demand over the last 8 periods is: [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92]. Calculations for the previous 5 samples (P4-P8) show a mean of 87.4 and a standard deviation of 28.9. For the full history (P1-P8), the mean is 92.25 and standard deviation is 25.1. Given the volatility (coefficient of variation ~0.27), a slightly more responsive approach is warranted to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. I will use the last 8 periods (all available data) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the variance while L remains 0. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to target a high service level (~80% target based on profit/holding cost), which is appropriate for a high-margin snack item.

Daily Reward (R_t): $385.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, current on-hand inventory is 15. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)', the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all 9 concluded periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history for the last 9 periods is [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100], while the pre-game samples were [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The demand shows some volatility (ranging from 51 to 138) but no clear sustained regime shift or seasonality as specific dates are not provided. The overall mean of all 14 observations (pre-game + history) is approximately 98.4, and the last 5 periods average 82.6. Given the volatility, I will use recent_N=5 (the minimum suggested for regime detection) to capture the most recent local demand average (82.6) while setting L to default (0). This helps the OR backend target a base stock level that accounts for recent lower demand periods while maintaining a buffer for the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $293.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 10 periods, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has averaged 91.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 24.3. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met in every single period (P1-P10). Currently, on-hand inventory is 23 units and there is no inventory in transit. Using the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, resulting in a z-score of approximately 0.84. To capture the full range of variability seen in the initial data while acknowledging the zero lead time, I will use all 10 periods of history (recent_10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the inventory targets remain responsive to the observed demand fluctuations while maintaining a healthy service level.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 11 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows moderate volatility but remains relatively centered around a mean of ~94 units, though recent periods (P11) saw a spike to 122 units causing a stockout. Given that current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I need to ensure the order covers the expected demand for Period 12. Since lead time is 0, the order will arrive within the same period. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand level more accurately, as the last sample was high. Using recent_N for both mu and sigma will help adapt to the slightly higher recent variance and mean.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown an upward shift compared to the initial periods. Over the last 5 periods (P8-P12), the mean demand is 102.4, and specifically in the last two periods (P11-P12), demand reached 122 and 119 resulting in stockouts. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0, the goal is to set parameters that ensure enough base stock to meet this higher demand regime immediately in Period 13. I'm using N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and higher volume while smoothing out the single highest peaks. The lead time remains at the default of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 7/8: average demand has increased to approximately 102 units per period compared to earlier lower volatility. Stockouts in P11 and P12 indicate a need for higher safety stock levels.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 7. Specifically, the last 7 periods (P7-P13) exhibit a mean demand of approximately 102.4 units, compared to the earlier periods. Stockouts occurred in P4, P11, and P12, indicating that the base stock level was insufficient to cover volatility during this higher demand phase. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met (L=0). To stabilize service levels and minimize stockouts while accounting for this recent regime shift, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7, covering the period since demand increased. This ensures the backend calculates parameters reflecting the current average of ~102 units and its associated standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a significant uptrend and frequent stockouts. Over the last 8 periods (P7-P14), demand has averaged approximately 105.6 units, compared to much lower levels in earlier periods. There have been stockouts in Period 11, 12, and 14, where demand exceeded units available. Specifically, Period 14 had a demand of 128 units, resulting in an ending inventory of 0 despite an arrival of 99 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), the inventory risk is concentrated entirely within the current period's demand. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using the recent 8-period average to capture the elevated demand regime and applying a recent_N sigma calculation to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand from P7 to P14 is 105.6 units/period. Frequent stockouts (P11, P12, P14) confirm that older demand data (P1-P6) is no longer relevant for forecasting current needs.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history from Period 7 to Period 15 indicates a significant and sustained increase in demand levels compared to the initial periods. The average demand in this new regime (P7-P15) is approximately 106.3 units per period. We have observed frequent stockouts (P11, P12, P14), suggesting that the service level provided by the current base stock logic needs to be robust to capture high-side fluctuations. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will continue to use L=0. I am choosing N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to specifically capture this current regime (starting from Period 7) while excluding the lower-demand data from Periods 1-6. This will ensure our inventory levels are calibrated to the current mean and standard deviation of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7 confirmed: average demand increased from ~82 to ~106 units per period (+29%). Frequent stockouts observed when demand exceeds 112 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $480.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to 170 units, causing a stockout after selling all 120 available units. This confirms that the demand regime has shifted to a higher mean and significantly higher volatility compared to the initial periods. The carry-over insights correctly identified a shift around Period 7, but the recent demand of 170 suggests the potential for much higher peaks than previously accounted for. Since the promised lead time is 0 and consistently arrives as such, L is set to 'default'. To respond to the recent volatility and prevent further stockouts, I am switching to recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=10 (covering the period since the confirmed regime shift at P7). This N captures the shift from ~80 to ~110+ while incorporating the high variance of the most recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly as of Period 16 (demand = 170), indicating that the regime starting at Period 7 has higher variance than initially observed. Stockouts continue to occur when demand spikes above 112 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. There is a confirmed and accelerating demand regime shift. Since Period 7, average demand increased significantly, and the last two periods have seen unprecedented spikes (P16: 170, P17: 213). This follows a string of stockouts (P11-12, P14, P16-17), indicating that traditional moving averages or the full history are severely under-forecasting current needs. The product is 'chips(Regular)', and although no specific holiday is mentioned, the sudden jump from ~110 units to >200 units suggests a strong seasonal or event-driven surge. To prevent further stockouts and capture lost sales, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will sensitize the OR backend to the most recent data (112, 170, 213), raising the base stock level to accommodate the new high-demand environment. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: P16 (170) and P17 (213) represent a significant departure from the P7-P15 average (~106). Current regime is now characterized by high volatility and demand exceeding 200 units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volume/high-volatility regime starting around Period 16. Specifically, demands in P16 (170), P17 (213), and P18 (166) average 183 units, which is significantly higher than the P7-P15 average of 106. We have experienced multiple stockouts (P16, P17) because previous parameter settings were anchored to the lower demand regime. For Period 19, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this new surge, effectively forecasting the one-period look-ahead (L=0) at approximately 183 units. Since demand is highly volatile, I am using explicit sigma_hat set to 30 to ensure sufficient safety stock against further spikes. Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent historical evidence from concluded periods. This aggressive ordering strategy aims to rebuild inventory and avoid further lost sales in this new high-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $836.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a second significant regime shift starting at Period 16. While the average from Period 7-15 was approximately 106, the demand in Periods 16-19 has been 170, 213, 166, and 231 (average 195). There have been stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods (P16, P17, P19), even after the OR backend adjusted for the previous regime. The current stockout at Period 19 despite a large order of 167 units and 42 units of carry-over stock confirms that demand is consistently exceeding 200 units during spikes. I will set the lead time to the promised 0 periods (the historical data consistently confirms 0-day lead time). I will use an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to proactively capture this high-demand scenario. Since lead time L=0, the target base stock is based on (1+L) periods, i.e., 1 period of demand. I forecast mu_hat to be 210 units based on the recent surge, and a high sigma_hat of 40 to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the observed volatility (range 166-231).

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: average demand increased from ~106 to ~195 units (+84%). High volatility observed with peak demand hitting 231. Stockouts frequent even with inventory levels near 200.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. Following the initial shift in Period 7, a more significant surge began in Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 20 (170, 213, 166, 231, 198), the new regime average is approximately 195.6 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. Prior periods (P1-P15) underrepresent current demand and volatility. Lead time consistent at 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), a service level of 80% is the baseline target, but frequent stockouts (P16, P17, P19) suggest even higher safety stocks are needed to capture full demand. Using N=5 (the duration of the latest regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current high-demand, high-volatility environment and prevent further lost sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $745.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a secondary regime shift starting at Period 16. In the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand has been: 170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193. This averages approximately 195 units per period, which is a significant increase from the previous average of ~106. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across the entire game history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 27 units and the persistent high demand, I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat will also be set based on the same window to provide sufficient safety stock against the observed high volatility (range 166-231). The lead time parameter L will remain at the promised default of 0, as confirmed by all concluded periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a second high-demand regime that began at Period 16. In the last seven periods (P16-P22), demand has averaged approximately 191.6 units (170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176) with significantly higher volatility than previous regimes. Using N=7 for the last 7 periods captures this current environment. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=7 ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current average demand of ~192 and the observed standard deviation, providing enough safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in P11, P12, P14, P16, P17, and P19.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. The most recent regime began at Period 16, showing a significant increase in both mean and variance. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 23 (8 samples), the average demand is approximately 198.75 units (170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176, 243). Despite ordering higher quantities, the system has experienced frequent stockouts (P16, P17, P19, P23), indicating that current base stock levels are insufficient to cover peak demand spikes, which have reached 243 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. To capture this high-demand regime while allowing for volatility, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the length of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine calculates the order based on the most relevant data reflecting the current ~199 unit average and the associated high variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand regime starting Period 16 is sustained with an average of ~199 units and high volatility (max demand 243). Lead time remains 0.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, moving from an average of ~106 units to approximately 198 units per period (Periods 16-24: 170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176, 243, 195). The average demand in this current regime (last 9 periods) is 198.3, with significant volatility (highs of 243, lows of 166). The current on-hand inventory is 28 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this high-demand/high-volatility regime while ignoring the outdated lower-demand periods (P1-P15), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9. This ensures the OR backend uses the mean and standard deviation from the current regime to set an appropriate base stock level and safety stock for Period 25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $704.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, moving from an average of ~106 units to approximately 199 units (P16-P25 average is 197.0). The last three periods (P23-P25) show demands of 243, 195, and 185. Although there is high volatility, the mean seems to have stabilized around the 190-200 level. Lead time consistency (L=0) is well-observed in every concluded period. To capture the current higher-demand regime while filtering out the noise from earlier low-demand periods, I am choosing N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This covers the entire period since the last major shift (Period 16 to Period 25). This window will provide a robust estimate of the current mean and high volatility, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent the frequent stockouts observed earlier in this regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 26, the mean demand is approximately 196.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. To maximize profit while accounting for the high volatility observed (with peaks up to 243 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 samples (the length of the current regime). This captures the current average of ~196 and the appropriate safety stock level to prevent the frequent stockouts seen in earlier spikes. The critical service level (q) is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), which the OR engine will use to set the base stock above the mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $868.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the high-volume regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 27, the average demand is approximately 196.6 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 27) was 219, which resulted in a stockout. Given that 'on-hand' inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in-transit, I need to set robust target levels to meet this high demand and prevent further stockouts. The lead time consistently remains 0 periods as evidenced by all 'conclude' messages in history. I am setting mu_hat using recent_12 to capture this specific high-demand regime (P16-P27) and setting sigma_hat with the same window to reflect the high volatility (range ~166 to 243) observed during this period. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the frequent demand spikes near 230-240 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained consistently high. From Period 16 to Period 28 (13 samples), the average demand is 199.38 units with a standard deviation of approximately 23.3 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. Despite high base stock levels, recent stockouts (P16, P17, P19, P23, P27) indicate that we need to maintain a robust safety stock. Setting N=13 for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 targets this specific high-demand regime. This ensures the base_stock calculation (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) is responsive to the current average of ~200 while providing protection against the observed variance.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-demand, high-volatility regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 29, the average demand is approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of approximately 24 units. In the most recent periods (P27-P29), demand has consistently been above 210, resulting in very low ending inventory (0, 6, and 4 units respectively). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid frequent stockouts observed when demand spikes, I will use recent_N (N=14, covering the entire current regime since P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend captures the higher mean (~201) and the significant volatility of this period, helping to maintain a safer inventory buffer above the 4 units currently on hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 16 is sustained: average ~201 units, high volatility with demand frequently exceeding 210 units (P27-P29).

Daily Reward (R_t): $855.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the high-volume state established at Period 16. Over the last 15 periods (P16-P30), the average demand is approximately 200.4 units, with significant volatility (max demand 243, min 166). Recent demand has stabilized further around 215 units (P28-P30). Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), which implies a critical ratio of 0.8, and the frequency of stockouts when demand spikes, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture this specific regime's mean and variance while excluding the lower-demand history prior to Period 16. This should provide sufficient safety stock to cover demand peaks without excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $884.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new phase of higher intensity and volatility. In Period 31, demand spiked to 276, the highest yet, surpassing the previous regime average (~201). Since Period 16, the mean demand has shifted significantly higher. To capture this recent volatility and prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 27, 31, and others, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=16 (covering the period from the start of the current high-demand regime at Period 16 to Period 31). This allows the OR engine to account for the increased mean (approx 204) and the substantially higher variance observed lately. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in Period 31 (demand=276), indicating that the regime starting at Period 16 may be increasing in mean or variance. Stockouts remain a risk when demand exceeds 220 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $699.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, moving from an average of ~106 units to approximately ~203 units (P16-P32). Recent volatility has increased, with Period 31 hitting a peak demand of 276. Period 32 demand was lower at 186, which brought the average back towards 200, but the risk of stockouts remains high when demand spikes above 215 given our high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.8). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle the sustained higher demand and recent volatility spike, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering Period 16 to Period 32) to capture the current demand regime's parameters accurately without being skewed by the lower-demand Periods 1-15.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed demand regime since Period 16 maintains an average of ~203 units with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation ~30) compared to previous regimes. Peak demand of 276 observed in Period 31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $681.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is characterized by a mean of approximately 203 units with significant volatility (standard deviation ~30). Recent demands are 276 (P31), 186 (P32), and 182 (P33). The high demand in P31 confirms that the system must handle large spikes to avoid stockouts. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To account for the current regime and the recent elevated volatility, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=18 (covering the period from the start of the current regime at P16 to P33). This allows the OR backend to compute a base stock level that reflects the higher mean and variance observed over this period, ensuring a sufficient service level for this high-margin product (profit $4 vs holding cost $1).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and remains in a high-mean, high-volatility state. Since P16 (19 periods ago), the average demand is approximately 201 units, with significant peaks reaching as high as 276 (P31). Recent demand (P32-P34) has softened slightly (186, 182, 171), but we must maintain a high base stock to protect against the proven upside volatility. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=19 to capture the entirety of this current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the increased mean (~201) and the high standard deviation observed relative to the first 15 periods, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost with an appropriate service level.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 35, the average demand is approximately 201.5 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. Recent demand in Period 35 was 222 units, following a quieter spell (Periods 33-34). The current on-hand inventory is very low at 4 units. Total demand in the most recent regime (N=20) captures the increased mean and volatility compared to the early stages of the game. I will use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the low-demand data from Periods 1-15 and focus on this confirmed sustained regime. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, which I will continue to utilize via the default method as it aligns with observed arrivals.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 16 remains sustained with high volatility. Recent demand values (P31: 276, P35: 222, P36: 240) indicate that the average remains around 200-210 units, but with a widening variance that has caused frequent stockouts (most recently in P36). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime across 21 periods (P16-P36) while giving weight to the more volatile recent behavior, I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=21. This matches the established regime length and ensures the OR backend accounts for the higher standard deviation (roughly 30+) observed since Period 16, which is necessary to maintain service levels in a high-profit/low-holding-cost environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $751.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in the regime that started around Period 16, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 203 units per period and significant volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 30). Recent demands (P31: 276, P36: 240, P37: 196) confirm this high-variance state. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with actual observations. I will continue to use a recent window of 20 periods (N=20) to capture the statistics of this current regime (starts approx. P18 to present), which effectively covers the shift while excluding the much lower demand from the early periods. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the increased volume and risk of stockouts observed when demand spikes above 210-220 units. Setting L to 'default' is appropriate as actual lead time historically matches the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $621.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' entered a high-volume, high-volatility regime starting around Period 16. Since Period 16, the average demand has been approximately 203.8 units with a peak of 276. In the most recent periods (P34-P38), demand has shown significant fluctuations (171, 222, 240, 196, 170). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To compute OR parameters, I am using a recent_N approach with N=23 (covering Period 16 to Period 38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime's behavior. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the higher mean and the elevated variance observed, balancing the high profit ($4.0) against the holding cost ($1.0) to maintain high service levels while managing ending inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $628.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 16 remains stable but highly volatile. Over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), the average demand is 204.8 units, with a peak of 276 (P31) and a low of 170 (P38). The current inventory (On-hand: 56) is insufficient to cover the expected demand for Period 40. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. To maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level via the OR backend), I will use the last 24 periods (since the regime shift at P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This capture the sustained higher mean (~202) and significant variance observed in this regime. While recent demand (P37-P39) has been slightly lower (~179), the volatility evidenced in P31 and P36 necessitates a robust buffer to prevent stockouts.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 203 units. Recent periods (P36-P40) show high volatility, with demand fluctuations between 170 and 240 units. The most recent demand (P40) was 223, leaving only 2 units on hand. To capture this regime while being responsive to the high variance and recent spikes like P36 (240) and P31 (276), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=25 (covering the regime from P16 to P40) and sigma_hat using the same N to ensure safety stock accounts for the observed volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 16 remains stable but highly volatile. Calculating the mean demand from Period 16 to Period 41 (26 samples) results in approximately 201.2 units per period. The recent behavior (Periods 35-41) continues this pattern with demand values reaching up to 240. Given the high criticality of avoiding stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), and the fact that we ended Period 41 with 0 on-hand inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 26 samples (regime_length) to capture this sustained high-demand period while ensuring the OR backend accounts for the volatility observed (max 276, min 166). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on all previous order history.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable but with significant volatility. The mean demand from Period 16 to 42 is approximately 203.4 units, with a standard deviation of 28.5. In the most recent 10-period window (P33-P42), the average demand is 202.0, confirming the regime's stability. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=27, covering the entire regime since the shift at P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the current high-volatility environment better than the full history, while still providing enough samples for a reliable standard deviation estimate to manage the frequent stockouts observed earlier.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 203 units per period and significant volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 31). Reviewing the most recent 10 periods (P34-P43), the average demand is 197.4, with a peak of 240. The current on-hand inventory is 51 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the objective is to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while providing a buffer for variance. Using N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations captures the regime since P16 effectively, balancing the recent volatility while providing enough data points for a stable estimate. Since the lead time is 0, the OR backend will calculate the order to reach the base stock target and satisfy the upcoming demand.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 16 remains stable but highly volatile. Since Period 16, the average demand is approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. Recent performance (P40-P44) shows demand alternating between high (226, 208) and lower (176) levels, reinforcing the need for a safety stock that can handle spikes above 220. The current on-hand inventory is 20 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the irrelevant lower-demand periods (P1-P15), I will use 'recent_N' with N=29 (covering periods 16 to 44). This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated based only on the active high-demand regime.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 16 remains stable and sustained. Analysis of the last 30 periods (P16-P45) shows an average demand of approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P41-P45) has been consistent at 226, 219, 176, 208, and 204. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high criticality of avoiding stockouts (Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=30 to capture the full scope of the current high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock high enough to buffer against the periodic spikes (e.g., P31 demand of 276) while accounting for the current mean.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. In the most recent 10 periods (P37-P46), the mean demand is 199.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.7 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in the history arriving within the same period. Current on-hand inventory is 18 units. To maintain a high service level given the profit margin ($4 profit vs. $1 holding cost, implying a target service level of 80%), I will use the recent 10-period window to capture the current mean and volatility. This approach ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current stable but high-volume regime while protecting against recent fluctuations like the demand spike in P41 and P44-P46.

The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 203 units. Recent demand (P47: 231) resulted in a minor stockout, suggesting that while the mean is stable, volatility remains high (recent peak of 276 in P31). With only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), the priority is ensuring sufficient stock to cover the remaining demand while minimizing end-of-game holding costs. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a N=32 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the entirety of the current regime starting from Period 16, which provides a representative mean and standard deviation for this sustained pattern.

Daily Profit: $832.00, Daily Holding Cost: $18.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $814.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. In the most recent block (Periods 33-48), the average demand is approximately 203.4 units with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 18 units, and there are no units in transit. Since the current period is 49 out of a total 50, this is the penultimate decision. Given the consistent performance of the 'recent_N' method for this stable regime, I will use N=16 to capture the statistics of the last 16 periods (P33-P48), which represents the most current and stable phase of the demand. This ensures the base stock reflects the recent mean of ~203 and the observed volatility, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $896.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume, high-volatility regime that began around Period 16. In the most recent block (Periods 16-49), the mean demand is approximately 203 units with a standard deviation of about 26. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Although the system is currently at zero on-hand inventory, the lead time of 0 allows orders placed in the current period to arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. To minimize stockouts while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=34 (covering the entire current regime since Period 16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the mean and variance of this specific demand stage. Lead time (L) remains 'default' (0) as no deviations from promised lead time have been observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 16 is fully stabilized: Average demand 203.2, Standard Deviation 26.2. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.
