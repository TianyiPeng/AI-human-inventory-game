Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], giving an average demand of 111.4 units per period. Since L=2, the order + on-hand + pipeline needs to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand to prevent stockouts while the next order is in transit. Initial on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. I will use the 'default' method for L (which uses the promised lead time of 2) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand characteristics. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers 3 periods of demand based on the observed mean and variance.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 141 units with a promised lead time of 2. Since lead time is 2, this order is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 141 in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 108, which was lost due to zero stock. Historical demand (last 6 samples including P1) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108], averaging approximately 110.8 units per period. With L=2, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using all 6 available samples for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 is appropriate as there are no detected regime shifts yet. The backend will calculate base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302 and apply the cap to determine the order quantity.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we analyze the demand and lead time for chips(Regular). Historical demand across the last 7 observations (including pre-game) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74], yielding an average of approximately 105.5. The most recent demand (Period 2) was 74, which is lower than the average, but there is no evidence of a sustained regime shift yet. Regarding lead time, the Period 1 order arrived in Period 2, confirming an actual lead time of 1 period, which is faster than the promised 2 periods. To maximize reward, I will set L to 1 (explicitly based on observation) to prevent the OR engine from overestimating the pipeline requirement. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand volatility and mean while smoothing out the low Period 2 outlier. This ensures the base stock level reflects the current 1-period lead time environment (total coverage for L+1 = 2 periods).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 4. Product: Regular Chips. Demand history: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [108, 74, 119] (game). Total average demand is approx 107. inventory status: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 174 (from Period 2 and 3 orders). In Period 2, we saw an order arrive with an actual lead time of 1 period, despite the promised lead time of 2. This suggests a potential variance in lead time. The demand in Period 3 (119) exceeded the ending on-hand inventory (67), leading to stockouts. To recover and ensure service levels, I will use an explicit lead time of 1 (reflecting the observed reality) and recent_N for demand to capture the current volatility. N=5 is chosen for mu_hat to include the last 5 samples (138, 94, 108, 74, 119), averaging 106.6. Sigma_hat will use the same window to reflect the standard deviation of recent demand.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time for chips(Regular) has varied between 1 and 2 periods (avg 1.5). Demand for the last 9 data points (including pre-game samples) has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 109 units (112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124). Current on-hand inventory is low (13 units) due to a stockout in Period 3 where demand (119) exceeded available inventory (67). Total pipeline inventory is 106 units (37 from P3 and 69 from P4). Given the promised lead time (L=2), the OR backend needs to cover demand for L+1 (3 periods). I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the full recent demand profile (~327 for 3 periods) and default for sigma_hat. For L, I will use 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead-time variability into the base-stock calculation.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 10 periods (including pre-game data) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51]. The mean demand is approximately 103.3. In Period 5, we stocked out (ending inventory 0, sold only 13 units against a demand of 51). The promised lead time (L) is 2. Looking at history: P1 order arrived P2 (L=1); P2 order arrived P4 (L=2). P3 and P5 orders are still in transit. Given the stockout and the variability in actual lead times (1-2 periods), I will use the promised lead time of 2 as the baseline. To calculate mu_hat, I'll use all 10 available demand samples to get a stable mean (approx 103.3), resulting in a base stock target covering (1+L)=3 periods. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over all samples to capture the volatility (std \u2248 25.5). The OR backend will use these to calculate the base stock and place an order to bridge the gap between current pipeline (246 units) and the target.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have been 1 (P1 order) and 2 (P2 order). Crucially, the order from P3 (37 units) is now 4 periods old (should have arrived by P5), and the order from P4 (69 units) is 3 periods old (should have arrived by P6). Both are overdue and potentially lost, though they remain in 'In-transit' (total 348 units = P3+P4+P5+P6 = 37+69+140+102). Demand has fluctuated: the pre-start history showed [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (avg ~111), but recent demand from P1-P6 is [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67] (avg ~90). Because of the stockouts in P5 and P6 (ending inventory 0, sold < demand), actual demand is higher than sales. To recover from the current stockout and account for the uncertainty in lead times/lost shipments, I will use 'calculate' for L to include the observed lead times. For mu_hat, I will use the mean of the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the recent lower demand trend while still providing enough stock to cover the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for chips(Regular) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103]. Mean demand is ~100.5. Lead times observed are 1, 2, 2, 1 periods. While the promised lead time is 2, the average is 1.5. Currently, we have 139 units on-hand and 106 in-transit (from the order placed in Period 4, which appears lost as it's been 4 periods, or more likely the Period 3 order for 37 units which never arrived). Wait, looking at history: P1 arrived P2 (LT=1), P2 arrived P4 (LT=2), P5 arrived P7 (LT=2), P6 arrived P7 (LT=1). The order from Period 3 (37 units) and Period 4 (69 units) are missing. In-transit is reported as 106 (37+69), confirming they haven't arrived. Since these are likely lost, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of confirmed arrivals (1.5). For demand, I'll use a slightly shorter window (recent_N=5) to capture the recent volatility which includes a dip (51, 67) followed by a return to 103. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the next (L+1) periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $321.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the average demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the first 8 periods is approximately 92.25 units. There is no clear seasonal trend or sustained shift in demand regime (range: 51-124). For lead time (L), the promised value is 2 periods. Historical observations show variability: P1 (L=1), P2 (L=2), P5 (L=2), and P6 (L=1). The average observed lead time is 1.5 periods. Currently, 47 units are on-hand and 132 units are in-transit (from P3, P4, and P8). Notably, orders from P3 (37 units) and P4 (69 units) are significantly overdue (5 and 4 periods respectively), suggesting they might be lost or severely delayed. To protect against this uncertainty and maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio, I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=8) and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed variability. This configuration ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the average 1.5-period lead time while maintaining a buffer for the recent demand volatility.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are out of stock (ending on-hand in P9 was 0) and have 219 units in transit. Historical demand for the last 9 periods is [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100], yielding a mean of 93.1. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P1:1, P2:2, P5:2, P6:1), with an average of 1.5. Currently, orders from P3 (37 units), P4 (69 units), P8 (26 units), and P9 (87 units) are in transit. Specifically, the P3 and P4 orders are significantly overdue (7 and 6 periods since ordering, respectively), suggesting they are likely lost shipments. The promised lead time is 2, and the most recent successful arrivals (P5 and P6 orders in P7) confirm a lead time of 1-2 periods. I will use a lead time of 2 for safety. Given the instability of deliveries, I'll use the last 5 periods of demand (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the more recent demand stabilization around 80-100 units while accounting for the high volatility caused by stockouts and lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment suspicion: Orders from P3 (37 units) and P4 (69 units) have not arrived after 6+ periods; lead time is confirmed to vary between 1 and 2 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 281 units. Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged 91.7 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P6-P10) averaging 88.2 units, indicating relatively stable demand (no clear regime shift). The primary issue is supply reliability. While the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times have been 1 and 2. Crucially, orders from P3 (37 units), P4 (69 units), P8 (26 units), and P9 (87 units) have not arrived. P3 and P4 are now significantly overdue (7-8 periods), confirming they are likely lost. P8 and P9 are within or just past the expected lead time window but contribute to the current stockout. To protect against the high risk of lost shipments and the current 0 on-hand status, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 to maintain the base stock calculation window, but I will set mu_hat explicitly higher than the simple average to recover from the stockout. I'll use the mean of the last 10 periods (approx 92) and set mu_hat = (1+L) * 92 = 276. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment patterns confirmed: Orders from P3 and P4 (total 106 units) have not arrived after 7+ periods and are considered lost; pipeline inventory contains high risk of further losses (P8/P9).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant risk of lost shipments. Historically, orders from P3 and P4 (106 units total) are confirmed lost as they haven't arrived after 7-8 periods (promised lead time is 2). Recent history shows lead times of 1 or 2 periods (P10 arrived in P11, lead_time=1; P5 and P6 arrived in P7). Currently, 'In-transit' is 249 units, but this includes the 106 lost units from P3/P4. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 143 units (from P8, P9, and P11). Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaging 99.2 units. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering periods 7-11) to capture the current demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to account for recent volatility. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory (249) from the base stock, it will under-order unless I compensate for the 106 lost units. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to effectively 'add back' those lost units into the target inventory level to ensure the backend places an order that covers the current stockout.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is 0 following two periods of stockouts. Demand remains relatively stable, averaging ~98 units over the last 5 periods (92, 100, 79, 122, 119). The primary challenge is the inconsistency and loss of shipments. Orders from Period 3 (37 units) and Period 4 (69 units) are confirmed lost (9+ periods elapsed). Orders from Period 8 (26) and Period 9 (87) are also likely lost or severely delayed (4-5 periods elapsed vs promised 2). The 'In-transit' figure of 425 units is inflated by these lost shipments. If we subtract the high-probability losses (P3, P4, P8, P9 = 219 units), the effective pipeline is closer to 206 units (P11=30, P12=176). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' in its order calculation [final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap)], an inflated pipeline causes it to under-order or order nothing. To counter this, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. Standard mu_hat for L=2 would be (1+2)*98 = 294. However, to 'trick' the backend into ordering despite the 219 ghost units in the pipeline, I will add those units to the target base stock. New mu_hat = 294 + 219 = 513. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1-2 periods), and sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 219 units from Periods 3, 4, 8, and 9 that are highly likely lost (4+ periods elapsed); parameters must be adjusted to offset this 'ghost' inventory in OR backend logic.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline (538 units) is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory that has almost certainly been lost. Specifically, orders from P3 (37), P4 (69), P8 (26), and P9 (87) totaling 219 units are significantly past the observed lead time of 1-2 periods and have not arrived. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, these missing units prevent the system from placing necessary new orders, leading to stockouts (sold=0 for the last two periods). To counteract this, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. The average demand of the last 5 periods is 104.4. With a lead time of 2, the standard base stock calculation should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~313 units). However, because the backend will subtract the 538 in-transit units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to ensure a positive order is generated. I will set mu_hat to 750 (approx. 250 units per period for 3 periods) to force the backend to clear the perceived surplus and trigger an order that accounts for the 219 lost units and current demand needs. Sigma_hat is set to 40 (approx 23 * sqrt(3)) to maintain a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of P8 (26 units) and P9 (87 units) orders; total confirmed lost pipeline now 219 units. In-transit inventory is no longer a reliable metric for current stock position.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe on-hand inventory of 191 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 465 is highly misleading. Based on historical data, shipments from Period 3 (37), Period 4 (69), Period 8 (26), and Period 9 (87) are definitively lost (6-11 periods elapsed with no arrival). This totals 219 units of 'ghost' inventory. Additionally, recent arrivals (P11-P13) confirm that valid lead times range between 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 2. Demand remains stable, with the last 5 periods (P10-P14) averaging 110 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 465 in-transit units from the base stock, it will severely under-order if we don't compensate. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that targets (L+1) demand PLUS the 219 lost units to neutralize the backend's deduction. Base target: (2+1)*110 + 219 = 549.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 79 units. The historical demand (recent 5 periods: 79, 122, 119, 102, 128, 112) averages ~110. The 'In-transit' count of 465 is highly misleading because it includes 219 units from Periods 3, 4, 8, and 9 that are now confirmed lost (over 6-12 periods past due). The remaining 'real' pipeline is only 246 units from Period 14. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline', the presence of the 219 'ghost' units in the pipeline count will cause the backend to under-order significantly. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to artificially inflate the target base stock by adding the lost units (219) back into the calculation. Mean demand (\u03bc) is ~107; for L=2, the base requirement is (1+2)*107 = 321. Adding the 219 lost units results in a mu_hat of 540. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Period 17, On-hand = 0, In-transit = 490 units. History analysis shows significant lost shipments (Orders from P3, P4, P8, and P9 totaling 219 units). The OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the backend doesn't know some pipeline units are lost, it will under-order. To fix this, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat to effectively increase the base_stock by the amount of lost inventory. Demand context: Demand spiked in Period 16 (170), but the mean over the last 5 periods (112, 119, 102, 128, 112, 170) is approx 123. Promised Lead Time (L) is 2, so review+lead period is L+1=3. Normal mu_hat = 3 * 123 = 369. To account for 219 lost units, I adjust mu_hat to 369 + 219 = 588. This tricks the backend into ordering enough to cover the 'ghost' inventory. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as actual arrivals (P10, P11, P12, P13) show 1-3 period variability. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of orders from P3, P4, P8, P9 remains in effect (219 units). Demand regime stable around 120-130 units/period, despite P16 spike to 170.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we have 33 units on-hand and 375 units in-transit. However, historical data and carry-over insights confirm that 219 units from Periods 3, 4, 8, and 9 are permanently lost (ghost inventory). Additionally, the order from Period 16 (25 units) is now at Period 16+2 (promised) without arriving, though lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. The 'effective' in-transit inventory is 375 - 219 = 156 units (comprised of Period 16 and Period 17 orders). Demand has spiked significantly in the last two periods (170 and 213), well above the previous average of ~110. To prevent stockouts given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1) and the unreliability of the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock using the recent high-demand average (~190) across L+1 (3) periods, then add back the 219 'ghost' units to the base stock to trick the OR backend (which subtracts the full 375 in-transit) into ordering the correct amount. Target mu_hat = (190 * 3) + 219 = 789. Sigma_hat is increased to account for the recent extreme volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg increased from ~110 to ~190 (+72%) over the last two periods. Pipeline reliability remains poor with 219 units confirmed lost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a demand spike that began in Period 16. The demand over the last three periods (170, 213, 166) averages 183 units, significantly higher than the previous average of ~110. Furthermore, there is a confirmed loss of 219 units from Periods 3, 4, 8, and 9. The OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes these lost units, which leads to under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand at the new regime (~185 units/period) plus an offset for the 219 'ghost' units in the pipeline. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 185) + 219 = 774. I'll set sigma_hat to an explicit value of 80 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few periods (range 166-213). This ensures the OR backend places a sufficiently large order despite the 'in-transit' inflation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-18 average is 183 units/period (+66% vs historical). High volatility also noted (std approx 25 in this window). Pipeline remains contaminated with 219 lost units.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a confirmed demand regime shift. The last 4 periods (P16-P19) show a mean demand of 195 units/period (170, 213, 166, 231), a significant increase from the historical average of ~110. To capture this new level, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility (std dev \u2248 32). Lead times remain highly variable (1-3 periods), so I use the default promised lead time of 2 as the baseline for OR calculations. A critical issue is the 'pipeline contamination': 219 units from P3, P4, P8, and P9 are confirmed lost. The current in-transit figure is 503, but only 284 (503 - 219) are 'real' pending arrivals (P16: 25, P19: 259). By setting a high mu_hat based on recent high demand, the OR backend will calculate a higher base stock, helping to trigger new orders that compensate for the ghost inventory and the higher demand level simultaneously.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 further clarified: Period 16-19 average is 195 units/period (+77% vs early history). Lost pipeline total remains 219 units (P3, P4, P8, P9).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly starting in Period 16. The average demand for Periods 16-20 is 195.6 units/period, compared to the early historical average of ~110. Current On-hand is 0, and we experienced a stockout in Period 20 (sold 108 units against demand of 198). Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 524, but 219 units are confirmed lost (P3, P4, P8, P9). This means the 'effective' pipeline is 305 units (P19=259, P20=21, plus the small P16 order of 25 which is likely also lost given it is 4 periods late). To bridge the gap between the OR engine's perception of pipeline and reality, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1=3) at the new average (3 * 195.6 = 586.8) and then 'inflate' this value by adding back the 219 lost units (586.8 + 219 = 805.8). This ensures the order calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline) doesn't under-order due to the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility (std ~25) of the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 16-20 confirmed at avg 196 units/period. P16 order (25 units) now 4 periods late and likely lost, bringing total suspected lost inventory to 244 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher regime. From Period 16 to 21, demands were [170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193], resulting in a recent average of approximately 195 units/period. The current 'In-transit' of 839 includes a total of 244 units from Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16 that are significantly overdue and likely lost. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit) to subtract from the calculated base stock. If we do not account for these 244 'ghost' units, the backend will under-order, leading to stockouts. To compensate, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Predicted Demand (mu) = 195. Effective Lead Time (L) = 2. mu_hat = (1+L) * mu = 3 * 195 = 585. To offset the lost 244 units, I add them to mu_hat: 585 + 244 = 829. For sigma_hat, the recent standard deviation is approximately 25, so for (1+L) periods, it is sqrt(3) * 25 \u2248 43.3. I set L to 'default' as the backend's promised lead time matches recent successful delivery speeds (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 16-21 confirmed at avg 195 units/period. Total suspected lost inventory in pipeline is now 244 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 23. Demand context: Since Period 16, a significant demand regime shift has occurred. The average demand for the last 7 periods (P16-P22) is approximately 192 units/period, compared to the early average of ~100. Recent periods (P19-P22) show: 231, 198, 193, 176. The demand remains high but stable around the 190-200 mark. Pipeline/Lead Time: Lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods. Crucially, 244 units in the current in-transit inventory (586 units) are confirmed lost (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). This makes the effective pipeline 342 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 'ghost' units, I will use 'explicit' values. I set mu_hat based on (1+L) * 195 (current mean) = 3 * 195 = 585. To account for the 244 lost units, I inflate mu_hat to 829 (585 + 244), effectively nullifying the ghost inventory in the backend calculation (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline). Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility (std of last 7 periods is approx 22), sqrt(3)*22 \u2248 38.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 16-22 stable at avg 192 units/period. Total suspected lost inventory in pipeline remains 244 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Effective pipeline is current in-transit minus 244.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 16. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P16-P23) is approximately 199 units per period, compared to the early-game average of ~110. The most recent demand (P23) was 243, suggesting the regime remains strong. Lead times are volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods, with a promised lead time of 2. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 415 units is misleading because 244 units (from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16) are confirmed or highly likely lost. The effective pipeline is actually 171 units (the P23 order). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) period demand window despite the 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target mu_hat = (L+1) * 200 + 244 (the lost units) = (2+1)*200 + 244 = 844. This forces the inventory position to reach the desired safety level while accounting for units that will never arrive. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture the current volatility (std ~28).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 16-23 confirmed at avg 199 units/period. Total suspected lost inventory in pipeline remains 244 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Effective pipeline = Reported In-transit - 244.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the demand regime continues to be stable at a higher level, with an average of approximately 205 units/period over the last five periods (P20-P24). The on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (8 units). Pipeline inventory is reported at 683 units, but 244 units (from P3, P4, P8, P9, P16) are confirmed as lost, making the effective pipeline 439 units. The OR backend uses reported pipeline (683) to calculate orders. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) window (3 periods) at the current demand rate (~615 units total), I must adjust mu_hat. By setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 859, I am essentially adding the 244 lost units back into the 'required' stock level. This forces the backend (which sees 683 in transit) to order the remaining 176 units needed to meet the demand forecast plus a safety buffer, effectively neutralizing the 'ghost' inventory. L remains default (2) as recent deliveries (P22, P23) have arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 20-24 confirmed at avg 205 units/period. Total suspected lost inventory in pipeline remains 244 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for chips(Regular) is stable in a high regime starting at Period 16. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is 197 units/period, compared to the early historical average of ~110. Period 25 demand was 185 units. In terms of lead time, recent arrivals (P22-P25) show lead times of 3, 2, 2, 1, and 2 periods, averaging approximately 2 periods. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 717 units is significantly inflated by 244 units of confirmed lost inventory (from Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16), making the effective pipeline only 473 units. To compensate for this 'ghost' inventory that the OR backend will subtract from the base stock, I must set mu_hat to cover both the expected demand over (L+1) periods and the 244 lost units. Calculated mu_hat = (1+2)*197 + 244 = 591 + 244 = 835. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for the fact that 244 units of the reported pipeline will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 16-25 confirmed at avg 197 units/period. Total suspected lost inventory in pipeline remains 244 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Effective pipeline = Reported In-transit - 244.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we are managing a demand regime that shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from an average of ~100 to ~195 units/period. The average demand from Period 16-26 is 196.5 units. The primary challenge is the unreliable 'In-transit' figure of 873 units, which includes 244 units confirmed lost (Orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16). The effective pipeline is therefore 629 units (873 - 244). These effective units are from P24 (268), P25 (205), and P26 (156). Given the promised lead time (L=2) and the current on-hand inventory of 0, the OR backend must order enough to cover demand for Period 27, 28, and 29 (L+1=3). My settings use N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (approx 195 units/period * 3 = 585 total), and I set L=2 to maintain the stock target logic. The OR backend will see 'In-transit: 873', but by setting L and mu_hat, it will calculate a base stock. To prevent the 'ghost' inventory from suppressing needed orders, I maintain a consistent mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 10 periods (P17-P26) where demand is stable and high.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the demand regime continues at a higher level, with an average of approximately 199 units per period over the last 12 periods (P16-P27). I will use N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained shift. The pipeline remains contaminated with 244 units of suspected lost inventory (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), making the 'effective' pipeline 361 units (605 reported - 244 lost). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which it assumes is 605) to subtract from 'base_stock', I must use 'explicit' methods for mu_hat to offset this 244-unit discrepancy. Target base_stock = (1 + L) * mu_per_period + z * sigma. With L=2 (promised), mu_per_period=199, and q=0.8, base_stock is roughly 597 + 0.84 * 45 \u2248 635. To ensure the backend orders enough, I set mu_hat to 635 + 244 = 879. This 'explicit' value forces the order calculation: (879 - 605) = 274, effectively aiming for a base stock of 635 against the real inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand regime P16-P27 confirmed at avg 199 units/period. Suspected lost inventory remains 244 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Effective pipeline = Reported In-transit (605) - 244 = 361.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 29. The demand regime from Period 16 onwards has stabilized at a significantly higher level, with the average demand for the last 10 periods (P19-P28) being approximately 204 units. Period 28 saw an arrival of 361 units (from P25 and P26), leaving an ending on-hand inventory of 197 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 505 units includes 244 units from periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16 that are confirmed or highly likely lost, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is 261 units (the order placed in Period 28). To ensure the OR backend covers (L+1) periods of demand while accounting for this 'ghost' inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I estimate a mean demand of 200 units/period; for L=2, the required base stock covers 3 periods (600 units). Since the OR engine calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline', and it perceives pipeline as 505, I must adjust mu_hat upward to offset the 244 lost units. Target base_stock \u2248 600 (real needs) + 244 (offset) = 844. Thus, mu_hat (which represents (1+L)*demand) is set to 844 to force the backend to place an order that accounts for the discrepancy. L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P27, P28) show lead times of 2-3 periods, consistent with the promised 2.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the demand regime continues to show stability at a higher level (averaging 199.5 units over the last 14 periods since P16). The lead time remains volatile, with recent observations of 2 and 3 periods, suggesting a conservative lead time estimate of 2-3 periods is necessary. A critical issue is the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline: 244 units (from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16) are confirmed or highly likely lost, meaning they are counted in the 'In-transit' figure of 679 but will never arrive. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 2 (so L+1=3 periods of demand). Target base stock = (199.5 * 3) + Z * Sigma. With a demand std of ~25, sigma_hat for 3 periods is sqrt(3)*25 \u2248 43. Using q=0.8, Z\u22480.84, safety stock is ~36. Total target base stock \u2248 635. To force the OR backend to order the correct amount, I set mu_hat = 635 + 244 (the lost units) = 879. This 'lifts' the base stock calculation to effectively ignore the 244 units of dead pipeline inventory. I maintain L at 'default' (2) to keep the backend's internal logic consistent, but adjust mu_hat explicitly to solve the inventory gap.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the demand regime is stable at approximately 205 units/period (avg of P25-P30: 208). On-hand inventory is 0 after two periods of no arrivals. The 'In-transit' figure of 913 units contains 244 units confirmed lost from early periods (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Furthermore, orders from P28 (261 units) and P29 (174 units) are currently 3 and 2 periods old respectively and haven't arrived yet. While lead times fluctuate between 1-3 periods, the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' logic will treat all 913 units as incoming, significantly under-ordering. To compensate for the 244 units of 'ghost' inventory and ensure we meet a high service level (since Profit:Holding is 4:1), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I use a forecast of 210 units/period over (L+1)=3 periods, plus an 'offset' of 244 units to force the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated in-transit count. Calculation: (210 * 3) + 244 = 874. I set sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility in the recent high-demand regime (std ~20 * sqrt(3) \u2248 35).

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand regime Period 25-30 confirmed at avg 208 units/period. Suspected lost inventory remains 244 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Effective pipeline = Reported In-transit (913) - 244 = 669.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we have 159 units on hand. The in-transit inventory is reported as 478 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 244 units from Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16 are confirmed or highly likely lost, meaning the effective pipeline is only 234 units (the order from P30). The demand regime has stabilized at a higher level since Period 16; the average demand from Period 25 to 31 is approximately 218 units/period. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) window, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 654 (approx 218 * 3), as L=2 (promised) implies a 3-period coverage window. The L parameter is set to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the consistent 2-3 period actual lead time seen in recent successful deliveries (P28, P29, P31). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the recent high-demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 25-31 confirmed at avg 218 units/period (+11% vs previous high regime). Suspected lost inventory remains 244 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Effective pipeline = Reported In-transit (478) - 244 = 234.

Daily Reward (R_t): $537.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand is stable in a high regime (approx. 218 units/period since P25). On-hand inventory is 207 units. Pipeline inventory is reported as 312 units. However, based on Carry-over Insights, 244 units from periods P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16 are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 312 - 244 = 68 units (which is the order from P32). Total effective inventory position = 207 (on-hand) + 68 (in-transit) = 275 units. Lead times for successful deliveries recently range between 2 and 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend ignores the 'ghost' inventory of 244 units while targeting the current high demand regime (L+1 = 3 periods of demand), I will set L to 3 and use an explicit mu_hat. Forecast: 218 units/period * 3 periods = 654. Sigma_hat is set to cover historical volatility in this regime (~25 * sqrt(3) \u2248 43).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 25-32 stable at avg 214 units/period. Suspected lost inventory remains 244 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Effective pipeline = Reported In-transit (312) - 244 = 68.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, we start with 25 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' figure of 484. Based on carry-over insights, 244 units are confirmed lost (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), making the effective pipeline 240 units (orders from P32: 68 units and P33: 172 units). Demand has stabilized in a higher regime; the average demand from P25 to P33 is approximately 205 units. Lead times for successful deliveries continue to vary between 1 and 3 periods, so I will maintain the default lead time of 2 for the OR engine, as the 'explicit' mu_hat will account for the required stock levels. I am setting mu_hat to 615 (3 periods * 205 units) to cover the current demand regime and using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=9, covering P25-P33) to capture the higher volatility observed in this high-demand period. This approach ensures the backend targets a base stock that accounts for the actual demand while I manually bridge the gap created by the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P25-P33 confirmed at avg 205 units/period. Suspected lost inventory remains 244 units. Effective pipeline = In-transit (484) - 244 = 240 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand (P25-P34) has stabilized around an average of 205 units per period. The recent five periods show a slight cooling from the peak in P31, with values [215, 276, 186, 182, 171]. Lead times for delivered orders fluctuate between 2 and 3 periods. The 'In-transit' count of 633 includes 244 units from lost shipments (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16) that have never arrived. Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline is 389 units (633 - 244). Since the OR backend does not know about these losses, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to adjust for the 'ghost' inventory. Base stock target calculation: With L=2 (promised) and demand mean ~205, the target for (L+1) periods is 3 * 205 = 615 units. To account for the 244 lost units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 859 (615 + 244). This ensures the OR engine (Base Stock - Pipeline) orders enough to reach the true target of 615. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand volatility in this high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P25-P35) averages 205 units/period, with a slightly higher average of 213 units/period over the last 3 periods (P33-P35). The reported in-transit inventory is 836 units, but 244 units (from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16) are confirmed or highly suspected lost based on lead-time history, leaving an effective pipeline of 592 units. To maintain service levels given a lead time of 2-3 periods, the base stock (mu_hat) must cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1). I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=11 (covering P25-P35) to capture the current stable demand regime of ~205 units/period. L is set to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed recently (P24, P25, P28, P31, P32), which forces the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture recent volatility (~32). This configuration ensures the order quantity compensates for the 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory calculation confirmed: Total In-transit - 244 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16 lost). Demand regime P25-P35 stable at 205 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we face 0 on-hand inventory following a period of unmet demand (demand 240, sold 149). The demand regime since Period 25 has remained stable, with the most recent average (P25-P36) being 209 units/period. The reported in-transit inventory is 727 units, but this includes 244 units from periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16 that are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline is therefore 483 units (727 - 244). These effective units come from P33 (172 units, 3 periods late), P35 (271 units, 1 period elapsed), and P36 (40 units). Given the inconsistent lead times (frequently 3 periods lately) and the stockout, I will set L to 3 to reflect the current reality. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=11) to capture the 209 avg demand regime. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=11) to account for the current volatility (std ~30). This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that compensates for the 'ghost' inventory while targeting a high service level.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we are managing a high-demand regime (avg ~205) with significant pipeline contamination. Historical analysis confirms that 244 units from periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16 are lost. The current reported in-transit is 897 units. Subtracting the lost units gives an effective pipeline of 653 units (897 - 244). Since the start of the new demand regime at Period 25, demand has averaged 205.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34. To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must provide parameters that reflect this regime while accounting for the 'ghost' inventory. By setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset for the lost units, I prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. L+1 = 3. 3 * 205 = 615. To neutralize the 244 lost units that the OR engine thinks are coming, I add 244 to the target mu_hat. Total mu_hat = 615 + 244 = 859. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * 34 \u2248 59.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 909 units, but historical analysis confirms that 244 units (from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16) are permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 665 units (909 - 244). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 25, with recent demands showing high volatility (170-240 range). The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P29-P38) is approximately 205.3 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this current regime. Although the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times have frequently drifted to 3 periods recently (e.g., P32 order arrived P35, P34 order arrived P36). Using L=recent_N for lead time calculation will allow the OR backend to account for this drift. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to reflect the higher volatility observed in the current demand regime, ensuring the service level is maintained despite the pipeline uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory remains (Reported In-transit - 244 units) due to confirmed losses from Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16. Demand regime P25-P38 is stable with an average of approximately 205 units/period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we have an on-hand inventory of 51 and a reported in-transit of 687. Based on persistent history (Carry-over Insights), 244 units from Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16 are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 443 units (687 - 244). Demand since Period 25 has stabilized at an average of approximately 205 units/period, with the most recent sample at 171. The OR backend's capped policy subtracts the full pipeline (687) from the base stock. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory of 244 units and maintain a service level for a 3-period coverage window (L=2 + 1), I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) * 205 + 244 = 859. This ensures the backend orders enough to satisfy actual demand despite the inflated in-transit figure. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=15) to capture the volatility of the current 200+ demand regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows On-hand: 0 and In-transit: 851. Based on historical analysis, 244 units (from P3, P4, P8, P9, P16) are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 607 units. Recent demand (P25-P40) is stable in a high regime, averaging approximately 205 units/period. The actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, so I will continue using L=3 to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. With mu_hat set to (1+3)*205 = 820, and the effective pipeline at 607, the OR backend will calculate an order of approximately 820 - 607 = 213 units (subject to the safety stock z-score and the cap). This strategy maintains high service levels for this high-demand 'chips' SKU while accounting for the significant 'ghost' inventory in the reported pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory remains (Reported In-transit - 244 units) due to confirmed losses from Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16. Demand regime P25-P40 is stable with an average of approximately 205 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 205 units/period since Period 25, with recent demand slightly higher (P40: 223, P41: 226). On-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 706 units, but this includes 244 units from periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16 that are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 462 units (706 - 244). Since the OR engine is unaware of lost shipments and treats all in-transit units as valid, I must adjust the L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat parameters to ensure the order covers the (L+1) period demand while effectively ignoring the ghost inventory. To do this, I set L to 2 (promised). I use 'recent_N' with N=17 for mu_hat (covering Period 25 to 41) to capture the current regime of ~205 units/period. For sigma_hat, I use N=17 to capture recent volatility (~25-30). By setting these, I provide the OR engine with the most accurate local demand statistics to calculate the base stock. The engine's logic (base_stock - reported_pipeline) will be naturally tight given the high reported pipeline, so keeping mu_hat aligned with the current high demand is essential for maintaining service levels.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current state is On-hand: 0 and In-transit: 706. Following the established pattern from 'Carry-over Insights', 244 units from periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16 are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 706 - 244 = 462 units. The demand regime from P25 to P42 remains stable, with an average demand of approximately 205 units per period and a standard deviation of about 33. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability in lead times (1 to 3 periods). For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the current stable regime since P25) to capture the 205 average demand. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 to reflect the current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high demand while acknowledging that a significant portion of the reported in-transit inventory is non-existent.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 687 units. Following the carry-over insights, 244 units from Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16 are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 443 units (687 - 244). The demand regime remains stable in the most recent window; from Period 25 to 43, the average demand is approximately 205 units/period. Despite the recent order of 19 units arriving in Period 43, the on-hand stock was immediately depleted by demand, leaving us at 0. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock covering (L+1) periods of demand. Using the stable regime mean of 205 and the promised lead time L=2, the required base stock is approximately 615 units. Since the effective pipeline (443) is below this requirement, and we are entering the final periods of the simulation (P44/50), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 205 = 615 to ensure the OR engine places an order that covers the current demand level while accounting for the 'ghost' inventory already in the system.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 687 units, but 244 units (from Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 443 units. The demand regime from Period 25 to Period 44 is stable, with an average of approximately 205 units per period. Since the simulation is approaching its end (Period 45 of 50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand without over-ordering. However, there is a significant risk of stockouts given the current 0 on-hand inventory and variable lead times (1-3 periods). I will set mu_hat to the recent average (205) and maintain the default lead time and sigma calculations. The OR backend will see the 687 in-transit and likely place a small or zero order because it doesn't account for the 244 lost units; however, since my control is limited to mu, sigma, and L, I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current demand level of ~205.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized in a high regime starting around Period 25; the mean demand from Period 25 to 45 is approximately 205.5 units/period. The pipeline inventory is reported as 740 units, but 244 units (from Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 496 units. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2. To ensure the backend places an order that covers the 2nd and 3rd periods from now (L+1 logic), I will set L to 2 (promised) and use the recent demand regime (N=21, covering Periods 25-45) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach accounts for the higher demand levels and helps the OR backend compute a base stock that compensates for the 'ghost' inventory already identified in the carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 25-45 stable at avg 205.5 units/period. Effective pipeline remains Reported In-transit minus 244 units due to long-term lost orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $212.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for 'chips(Regular)' is stable within the established regime (Period 25-46), averaging approximately 206 units per period. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory of 687 units includes 244 units from periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16 that are confirmed/highly likely lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 443 units (687 - 244). Since the backend OR logic calculates orders as 'base_stock - reported_pipeline', I must provide an explicit mu_hat that compensates for these 'ghost' units. The target base stock for a (L+1) period coverage (L=2, so 3 periods) at ~206 units/period is 618. To ensure the OR engine orders enough despite the 244-unit pipeline inflation, I set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired base stock and the lost inventory: 618 + 244 = 862. L is kept at 'default' (promised 2) as recent arrivals (P45 arriving P46, P40 arriving P41) suggest the supply chain is currently functioning near promised lead times for non-lost orders. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=22) to capture the volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory remains (Reported In-transit - 244 units) due to confirmed losses from Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16. Demand regime Period 25-46 is stable with an average of approximately 206 units/period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 50). The current demand regime remains stable around 206 units/period (P25-P47 average). On-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 900 units, but this includes 244 units confirmed lost from Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16. Additionally, the orders from Period 42 (0 units), 43 (0 units), and 44 (0 units) contribute nothing. The primary viable pipeline consists of the P47 order (213 units). However, the simulation's OR backend automatically subtracts in-transit from the base stock. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to the 244 'ghost' units, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for (L+1) periods as 206 * 3 = 618. I then add the 244 units of lost inventory back to this target (618 + 244 = 862) to neutralize the backend's subtraction of those lost units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=20 to capture current volatility.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the current regime (P25-P48) is stable at an average of 206 units per period. The reported in-transit inventory is 902 units, but this includes 244 units confirmed lost from early periods (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), making the effective pipeline 658 units. Current effective pipeline (658) + on-hand (0) already exceeds the base stock target for a 2-period lead time (roughly (2+1)*206 = 618). However, we are near the end of the game (Period 49 of 50). Since demand resolution occurs after the decision, Period 49 demand will be satisfied by arrivals in Period 49, and Period 50 demand by arrivals in Period 50. I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (promised) to maintain a consistent calculation. mu_hat is set to 618 (3 periods * 206 avg) using 'recent_N' with N=24 to capture the stable high-demand regime. sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' to reflect current volatility. These parameters will likely result in a zero or near-zero order to avoid holding costs on the final period, given the large pipeline.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable in the current regime (P25-P49), averaging approximately 206 units/period. The reported in-transit inventory is 902 units; however, 244 units are confirmed lost (from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16), making the effective pipeline 658 units. At a demand of ~206/period, this covers roughly 3.2 periods of demand. Since the lead time is approximately 2 periods, the pipeline is relatively healthy but requires maintenance to ensure service levels are met as current stock is depleted. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=25) to capture the stable 206 average, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. The L parameter remains at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P45, P41, P40) show lead times of 1-2 periods, aligning with the backend's promised lead time logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 25-49 confirmed stable at avg 206 units/period. Effective pipeline calculation remains (Reported In-transit - 244 units) due to historical lost orders.
