{
  "rationale": "1. **Lead-Time Inference**: Consistent historical data from Period 1 through Period 47 confirms that the actual lead time is 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. \n2. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand has been high and somewhat volatile, with Period 47 recording a demand of 231. Looking at the last 10 periods (P38-P47), the average demand is approximately 203.4 units. There is no clear evidence of a significant new regime shift downward; rather, the demand remains in the higher tier established around Period 18 (~200+) with continued volatility.\n3. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand inventory is 0 units. Since lead time is 0, orders placed now will arrive and be available for Period 48 customers.\n4. **OR Baseline Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 212 units. This is based on a critical fractile balance and historical means. Given the 0-period lead time, we need to order enough to satisfy Period 48 demand. \n5. **Strategy**: With only 3 periods left (48, 49, 50), I will stick close to the OR recommendation but round slightly upwards to 215 to provide a small buffer against the recent high demand (like P47's 231) while minimizing the risk of excessive holding costs for the final turns. A quantity of 215 aligns with the average of recent high-demand periods.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game, matching the promised lead time. The demand regime shifted around Period 18 and has remained elevated. Over the last 10 periods (P39-P48), demand has averaged approximately 207 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 21. My current on-hand inventory is 7 units, and there are no units in transit. The OR recommendation of 206 units is based on historical averages that likely still include the much lower pre-shift demand (Periods 1-15), which might cause it to underestimate the current needs. Since this is Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, I need to ensure I have enough stock to meet demand for these last two periods while minimizing final holding costs. Expected demand for P49 is ~210. With 7 on-hand, an order of 210-215 units should safely cover immediate demand without excessive waste.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordering 213 units to match the recent 10-period demand average (~207) and account for very low current inventory (7). This slightly exceeds the OR recommendation (206) to better reflect the sustained higher demand regime.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data from Periods 1-49 confirms that orders consistently arrive in the same period they are placed (actual lead time = 0). Since Period 50 is the final period of the game, there is no value in holding any ending inventory, as holding costs are $1.0/unit and there are no subsequent periods to sell remaining stock. The strategy for the final period is to order exactly enough to satisfy expected demand while accounting for the current on-hand inventory of 0. Recent demand (Periods 40-49) has averaged approximately 215.8 units per period, with a range between 176 and 231. The OR recommendation is 214 units, which is based on historical averages and capped for smoothing. Given that demand in the most recent periods (47-49) has been 231, 208, and 224, a slightly higher order than the OR recommendation is prudent to capture potential sales in the final period without excessive risk, even though holding costs for any overage would reduce the period's profit.",
