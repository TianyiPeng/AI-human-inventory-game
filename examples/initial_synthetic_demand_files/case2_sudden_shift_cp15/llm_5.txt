(b) No previous period data or calendar events are available to modify the prior demand estimate. (c) Lead time is promised at 2 periods. To avoid stockouts while waiting for the first delivery, I must account for the current period (P1), plus the lead time periods (P2, P3), as the order placed now will arrive during P3's arrival phase and be available for P4. However, with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to cover demand for the immediate periods as soon as possible. (d) Current pipeline: 0 on-hand + 0 in-transit. (e) Decision: Aiming to cover roughly 3 periods of demand (P1, P2, P3) to establish a baseline inventory, though P1 and P2 will inevitably stock out due to the 2-period lead time. Target stock level = 111.4 * 3 \u2248 334 units. I will order 335 units to start the pipeline.",

There are 600 units in-transit (ordered in P28, P27 - though P27 arrived in P28, so the 'In-transit' figure of 600 likely represents orders from P26, P27, P28 depending on timing, but based on the history, orders from P26, P25, and P24 arrived in P28). Specifically, looking at the 'In-transit' of 600 and the history: P28 ordered 200, P27 ordered 200, P26 ordered 200. These 600 units are the current pipeline. Total position = 387 (on-hand) + 600 (in-transit) = 987 units. Target stock for (L+1) = 4 periods (max lead time 3 + 1) at ~200 demand/period is 800 units, plus safety stock for volatility. With 987 units already accounted for, I have enough to cover the next ~4.9 periods.

Demand is stable at approximately 210-230 units. Because P50 is the final period, any order placed now (P49) would only arrive in P49 (if LT=0) or P50 (if LT=1). Promised lead time is 2, and while LT=1 has occurred recently, LT=0 has never been observed. Therefore, an order placed in P49 is highly unlikely to arrive in time to satisfy P49 demand, and may only arrive for P50. However, with 1840 units already in-transit, including orders from P43, P46, P47, and P48, the probability of at least one of those shipments (each 200-220 units) arriving in P49 or P50 is extremely high.
