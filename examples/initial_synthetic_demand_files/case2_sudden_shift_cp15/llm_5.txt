Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I must order enough to cover the window of (L+1) periods, which is 5 periods in this case. Total target pipeline = 111 * 5 = 555 units. Given that holding costs are relatively high ($1.0) compared to profit ($4.0), I will aim for a target that covers expected demand with a small buffer until I can observe the actual lead time and demand variance in this specific environment.",

This sequence ensures we have enough to meet the ~200-210 average demand for the next few periods despite the current 0 on-hand. Total in-transit is 890. Expected demand for the 5-period risk window (P45-P49) is ~1050 units. Pipeline is 890. Shortfall is approximately 160 units. I will order 210 units to maintain a safety buffer and ensure fulfillment through the end of the game (Period 50).",

With the game ending at Period 50, orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive (P47 order arrives P51, P48 arrives P52, etc.). Therefore, Period 46 is the final order that will actually arrive (at the start of Period 50, in time for Period 50's demand resolution). Inventory calculation: On-hand: 26. In-transit arriving P46: 300 (ordered P42). Arriving P47: 210 (ordered P43). Arriving P48: 150 (ordered P44). Arriving P49: 210 (ordered P45). Total inventory available before the P46 order arrivals: 26 + 300 + 210 + 150 + 210 = 896. Expected total demand for periods 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 (5 periods) @ 210 units/period = 1050. To cover this demand and minimize stockouts in the final period, I need 1050 - 896 = 154 units. I will order 160 units to provide a small safety buffer for the final periods.",

With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47, P48, P49, P50) and a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 47) will arrive in Period 51, which is after the game concludes. Therefore, further ordering is unnecessary as it would only incur holding costs or contribute to ending inventory without the possibility of being sold. The current pipeline consists of orders from P43 (210 units), P44 (150 units), P45 (210 units), and P46 (160 units), which are scheduled to arrive in P47, P48, P49, and P50 respectively.

Period 48 (Period_48) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are at Period 48 of 50. The game ends at the conclusion of Period 50. Because the lead time is consistently 4 periods, any order placed in Period 47 arrived in Period 51 (outside game scope), and an order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (outside game scope). Thus, current on-hand inventory plus upcoming scheduled deliveries from previous orders must satisfy all remaining demand. The pipeline is as follows: Period 48's arrivals (ordered P44: 150 units), Period 49's arrivals (ordered P45: 210 units), and Period 50's arrivals (ordered P46: 160 units). Current on-hand is 97. Total inventory available for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50) is 97 (OH) + 150 (P48 arrival) + 210 (P49 arrival) + 160 (P50 arrival) = 617 units. Considering the demand regime is ~210-230 units per period, 617 units covers roughly 2.7 to 3 periods of demand. Since any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends, I will place an order of 0 to avoid unnecessary 'In-transit' accounting, though it technically doesn't affect the score.",

With the game ending in Period 50, I must focus on covering demand for Periods 49 and 50 while minimizing ending inventory and holding costs. We are currently at Period 49. On-hand inventory is 39. In-transit arrivals expected for Period 49 (from P45 order) and Period 50 (from P46 order) are 210 and 160 units respectively. \n\nCalculations:\n- Period 49 Start: 39 on-hand.\n- Period 49 Arrival (from P45, LT=4): 210 units.\n- Period 49 Inventory available for demand: 39 + 210 = 249.\n- Period 49 Expected Demand: ~210.\n- Period 49 Closing Inventory: ~39.\n- Period 50 Start: ~39.\n- Period 50 Arrival (from P46, LT=4): 160 units.\n- Period 50 Inventory available for demand: 39 + 160 = 199.\n- Period 50 Expected Demand: ~210.\n\nSince the game ends after Period 50's demand resolution, any order placed now (Period 49) would arrive in Period 53 (49+4), which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, the order should be 0 to avoid wasted capital and unnecessary holding costs, although any order placed now wouldn't even arrive to be charged holding cost. The primary concern is that Period 50 might face a slight stockout (~11 units), but since we cannot get new stock in time, the optimal action is to order 0.",
