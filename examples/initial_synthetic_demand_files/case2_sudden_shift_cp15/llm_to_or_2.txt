Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance data Beyond the provided 5 seed demand points [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The mean of these points is 111.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.67. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the formula (1+L) * mean, the expected demand over the lead time and review period is 5 * 111.4 = 557. Since there are 0 units on hand and 0 in transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately to prevent stockouts, especially considering the 4-period lead time. I will use the default methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the initial parameters.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 141 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, nothing arrived in Period 1 (arrivals happen after the decision phase, and with L=4, we won't see this order for several periods). The 'In-transit' balance of 141 reflects this pending order. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (including the newly reported Period 1) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108], showing relatively stable behavior around a mean of ~111. Given the promised lead time of 4, our targets for mu_hat and sigma_hat should cover (L+1) = 5 periods. I am using all available historical data (N=6) to calculate the demand parameters as the regime appears stable.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, the demand for chips(Regular) over the last 5 pre-game periods was [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean=111.4). In Period 1 and 2, demand was 108 and 74 respectively. The total observed mean including in-game periods is 105.57. The promised lead time is 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 278 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since L=4, we don't expect the P1 order (141 units) to arrive until Period 5 (visible in the P5 conclude message at the start of P6). Because the starting on-hand is 0 and we have missed sales in P1 and P2, we need to maintain a consistent ordering strategy to fill the pipeline. I will use 'default' for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=7 (all 5 past + 2 in-game samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the slightly lower recent demand while maintaining a buffer for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The product has a promised lead time of 4 periods. The history shows orders placed in Period 1 (141 units), Period 2 (137 units), and Period 3 (139 units), totaling 417 units in-transit. None of these have arrived yet because even for a lead time of 4, the first order (P1) is only expected to arrive during the 'arrival resolution phase' of Period 1+4 = Period 5. This arrival will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have lost all demand for Periods 1-3 due to zero starting stock. The historical demands provided are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [108, 74, 119] (in-game). The combined mean is approximately 107. Since there are no concluded lead times yet, I will stick to the default promised lead time and use all 8 available demand samples to estimate parameters. This ensures we cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5 periods).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The total past demand for the last 5 periods (including pre-game) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the game demand for Periods 1-4 is [108, 74, 119, 124]. The average demand is approximately 109 units per period with a standard deviation around 19. Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) are expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5 (which occurs after our decision). Currently, On-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (as expected for L=4). In-transit is 556 units (141+137+139+139). To set parameters: L remains at 4 (default). mu_hat is set to (1+L) * average demand. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (all available data points) to capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for the high lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6. The first order (placed in Period 1) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. Since the arrival occurred in Period 5's arrival phase, it was visible for the first time in the Period 5 conclude message, which we are reading now. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was [108, 74, 119, 124, 51]. While the most recent demand (51) is lower than the initial average, it is too early to conclude a sustained regime shift. The 'In-transit' quantity of 440 units consists of orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5 (137+139+139+25 = 440), which are expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively. Given the consistency of the lead time so far, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the average demand across all available game periods while excluding the pre-game samples, as the game demand seems slightly different in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by arrivals in Period 5 (ordered P1) and Period 6 (ordered P2). Current on-hand inventory is 160 units, with 309 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Demand history shows a shift: periods 1-4 averaged 106.25 units/period, while periods 5-6 averaged 59 units/period. The most recent 5 samples (P2-P6) average approximately 87 units. To avoid over-ordering during this apparent lower demand phase while accounting for the lumpy arrival of the initial stock-out period, I will use a N=5 window for both demand and volatility estimates. This balances the high initial demand with the recent drop. Since L is confirmed as 4, the OR engine needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time L=4 is confirmed by historical arrivals (orders from P1, P2, and P3 all arrived exactly in 4 periods). History shows raw demand for Period 1-7 as: 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103 (Mean \u2248 92.3). However, there is a noticeable split: periods 1-4 averaged 106.25, while periods 5-7 (the most recent) averaged 73.7. This suggests a potential downward shift or high volatility in the recent regime. Given the current high inventory levels (On-hand: 196, In-transit: 198), even with L=4 (covering L+1=5 periods of demand), our current stock (394 units) covers nearly 4-5 periods of demand at the higher historical average. I will use recent_N with N=7 for demand to capture the full recent history while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock. The sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 7 periods to capture the observed variance.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of past demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92] reveals a historical mean of approximately 100 units. Recent demand (P5-P8) has averaged 78.25 units, which is lower than the initial context of 111.8 units (P-4 to P1). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by the arrival of orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 in periods P5, P6, P7, and P8 respectively. Currently, we have 243 units on hand and 180 units in-transit (ordered in P5: 25, P6: 6, P7: 28, P8: 121). The 'base_stock' must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the long-term average (N=13) provides a safer buffer given the early high demand spikes, while L is set to default as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing historical demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100], the mean is approximately 100 units/period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages for Period 5 through 9. Currently, on-hand inventory is 168 and in-transit is 276 (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). This pipeline total (444) covers approximately 4.4 periods of demand, which aligns with the (L+1) requirement for a 4-period lead time. No significant demand shift is detected; recent demand remains stable around the long-term average. I will use the default promised lead time and recent statistics (N=9) to calculate the order parameters, ensuring the base stock level targets roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $221.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward shift starting around Period 5. The pre-game demand samples averaged ~111.4, while the last 6 periods of game history (Period 5-10) have averaged approximately 82.0 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as observed in all completed delivery cycles (P1-P6 orders). With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 6 periods of demand (N=6) captures this regime change better than the long-term average, reducing the risk of overstocking and excessive holding costs. The In-transit inventory of 338 units includes orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10. Specifically, P7 (28 units) is expected to arrive during P11, P8 (121 units) during P12, P9 (121 units) during P13, and P10 (68 units) during P14.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 5 onwards: average demand decreased from ~111 to ~82 (-26%).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is critically low (1 unit) following a Period 11 demand of 122 units. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. Since Period 5, demand has shifted into a lower regime: [51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79, 122], with an average of ~87.7. Although Period 11 saw a spike (122), the 7-period average remains well below the initial 111 average. We have 326 units in-transit: (P8: 121, P9: 121, P10: 68, P11: 16). The order from P8 (121 units) is expected to arrive during Period 12 and be visible at the start of Period 13. To manage the current demand regime and account for the 4-period lead time (L=4 implies 1+L=5 periods of coverage needed), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the most recent regime shift behavior while smoothing out the Period 11 spike.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the chip category is in a stable but lower demand regime compared to the first four periods. The average demand from Period 5 through Period 12 is approximately 91.6 units per period, which is higher than the previously noted '82' but still well below the initial 111 average. Lead time is consistent at the promised 4 periods (L=4). There are 333 units in transit, which includes orders from Period 9 (121), Period 10 (68), Period 11 (16), and Period 12 (128). An arrival of 121 units (from Period 9) is expected during Period 13 resolution, which will resolve the current low stock (3 units). To set OR parameters, I will use a recent window of 8 periods (Period 5-12) to capture the current demand regime. L is set to default (4). mu_hat will be based on the last 8 periods to reflect the shift, and sigma_hat will also use the last 8 periods to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand from Period 5 to 12 is approximately 92 units/period, down from the initial ~111 units/period.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a stable demand regime after a shift that occurred around Period 5. The mean demand from Period 5 through Period 13 is approximately 92.9 units per period (compared to ~111 in the first few periods). The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 1 through 9. Current on-hand inventory is 22, with 345 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P10, P11, P12, and P13). To calculate the base stock, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the behavior since the regime shift at Period 5. This allows the OR engine to use the lower mean demand (~92.9 vs ~105 overall) and current variance to determine the optimal inventory level for the (L+1) horizon. Setting L to default (4) is appropriate as observed lead times match promised lead times exactly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 following a stockout in Period 14 where demand (128) exceeded starting inventory (90). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The average demand has fluctuated: Periods 1-4 averaged 106.25, Periods 5-11 averaged 89.1, and the last 3 periods (12-14) averaged 116.3. Since there's no clear calendar event to suggest a sustained surge, the recent high demand is likely variance or a slight reversal of the previous downward trend. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat (covering Periods 5-14) to capture the current stabilized regime which averages approximately 97 units per period. This balances the lower demand observed in mid-history with the recent spikes, providing a robust base stock to recover from the current stockout and cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in Periods 14 and 15 significantly outpaced the small arrivals from orders placed during the local minimum order period (Periods 10 and 11). However, the lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. The in-transit pipeline (513 units) is substantial, including large orders from Periods 12 (128 units), 13 (133 units), 14 (132 units), and 15 (120 units). The first of these (128 units) is expected to arrive in the current Period 16 (resolving after this decision), which should resolve the stockout. Demand analysis shows a shift: while earlier insights suggested a decrease, demand in the last 5 periods (P11-P15: 122, 119, 102, 128, 112) has averaged 116.6 units, returning to levels seen at the very start. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this return to higher demand while acknowledging the consistent lead time of 4. This ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~583 units), which is well-supported by the current pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand has returned to original levels: average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is ~117 units/period, reversing the decrease noted in P11/P13.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) even though 128 units arrived last period, because demand spiked significantly to 170 units. The carry-over insight from Period 16 correctly identified a return to higher demand levels. Reviewing the last 5 periods (P12-P16), the demand values were 119, 102, 128, 112, and 170, resulting in an average of 126.2 units per period. This confirms the regime shift mentioned in the P16 carry-over. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current demand is volatile and trending upwards (spike to 170), I will use the recent_N method (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-volume and higher-variance behavior. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock reflective of the current 126+ demand level rather than the previous lower regime (~92). We have 474 units in-transit, which aligns with orders from P13 (133), P14 (132), P15 (120), and P16 (89), so the pipeline is full and consistent with the L=4 lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16: average demand of last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 126.2 units, a significant increase from the previous ~92 unit average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a high-magnitude regime shift starting around Period 14/15, with demand peaking at 213 in Period 17. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in the last four periods (P14-P17). Although 132 units are expected to arrive in Period 18 (ordered P14), they will likely be consumed immediately by the current high demand. To catch up and maintain service levels, I'm using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current high-demand surge (P14-P17 mean = 155.75). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. I'm also using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to account for the increased volatility associated with the higher mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 14 onwards shows a significant surge, with Period 14-17 average demand at 155.75 units/period compared to the previous average of ~92.

Daily Reward (R_t): $528.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14. Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), demand has been [128, 112, 170, 213, 166], averaging 157.8 units, which is a marked increase from the previously observed averages of ~92 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and despite arrivals, we have experienced stockouts (sold < demand) for the last five consecutive periods. Using a recent demand window (N=5) for Period 14-18 is appropriate to capture this higher mean and volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals in the history. To address the stockouts and higher demand, mu_hat is set using the recent_N method (N=5) to reflect the 157.8 average, which for a lead time of 4 plus the current period (L+1=5) evaluates to a total base stock requirement of ~789 units before accounting for safety stock via sigma_hat. This will prompt the OR backend to increase order quantities to meet the new demand level and recover from the on-stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 14 onwards shows a sustained increase, with the last 5 periods (P14-P18) averaging 157.8 units/period.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 178.4 units per period (112, 170, 213, 166, 231), which is a substantial increase from previous averages (~92 and later ~117-126). Inventory is currently at zero on-hand due to this surge exceeding arriving shipments. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this high-demand phase, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N approach with N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime (starting from P14). This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock that accounts for the current demand velocity and volatility (L+1 = 5 periods of demand), aimed at recovering inventory levels while balancing the carrying cost/stockout trade-off.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: average demand increased from ~92 to ~178 units (+93%) over the last 6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 14. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P14-P20) is approximately 174 units per period (128, 112, 170, 213, 166, 231, 198). This is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~92 units. Despite large arriving orders, on-hand inventory remains at 0 due to demand consistently exceeding recent arrivals. The promised lead time of 4 holds (observed consistently in conclude messages). To capture this higher demand regime and stabilize the stock levels, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend uses the mean and variance from the high-demand period while maintaining a service level based on the current profitability ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~92 to ~174 units (+89%) based on P14-P20 data. Service levels are currently low due to stockouts, necessitating higher base stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $680.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14, where demand increased from a mean of ~92 to ~185 units per period. The last 5 periods (P17-P21) show demand levels of 213, 166, 231, 198, and 193, averaging 200.2 units. The system is currently experiencing frequent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 since P14), resulting in lost sales and low service levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. To address the demand surge and recover from stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the high-demand regime (P14-P21 average is 187.38). Sigma_hat is also set using the last 8 periods to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level. The Lead Time L is set to default (promised 4) as there is no evidence of delay or loss.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 updated: Mean demand for the period P14-P21 is approximately 187 units (+103% vs previous regime), with the most recent 5 periods averaging 200 units.

The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 14. For the most recent 9 periods (P14-P22), the average demand is approximately 176 units (128, 112, 170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176). The last 5 periods (P18-P22) have been even higher, averaging 194.8 units. Current on-hand inventory is low (55) following a string of stockouts (P14-P21). I will set mu_hat based on the recent 9-period regime (N=9) to capture this higher mean of ~176. Given L=4, mu_hat should reflect demand over L+1 (5) periods, which at ~176/period equals 880. Using the recent_N method with N=9 allows the OR backend to calculate this based on the observed shift. This high base stock is necessary to recover from previous stockouts and maintain service levels in the face of sustained high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 updated: Mean demand for the period P14-P22 is approximately 176 units (+91% vs pre-P14 low-demand regime). Most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) average 194.8 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P14-P23), the average demand is 183.0 units. Focusing on the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23), the average demand is higher at 208.8 units, reflecting a continuing upward trend or a stabilization at a higher level than the previous regime. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the 'Period 23 conclude' message showing the P19 order arrived on schedule). Currently, on-hand inventory is 35 units and there are 676 units in-transit. To avoid further stockouts and maximize profit (given the 4:1 profit to holding cost ratio), I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current high-demand regime while providing enough stability against recent volatility. N=10 covers the entirety of the high-demand shift since P14. This will set the base stock level to cover demand over (L+1) = 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 has potentially plateaued or is slightly increasing: average demand for P14-P23 is 183.0, while the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) average 208.8.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 14 and has stabilized at a much higher level. The most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) have an average demand of 201 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 65 and pipeline inventory at 703 units (total 768), and a lead time of 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 11 periods (P14-P24) as the current regime (average ~185), but weighing the most recent 5 periods (average ~201) more heavily suggests mu_hat should reflect the higher demand to avoid stockouts. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent volatility and mean of this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 14-24 has stabilized; most recent 5 periods average 201 units, significantly higher than the pre-P14 average.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has stabilized at a significantly higher level compared to the beginning of the simulation. Period 25 concluded with a stockout (ending on-hand: 0) as demand (185) exceeded the starting inventory (168 from Period 21 arrival + Period 24 carryover). The most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) have seen an average demand of 198.4 units. To address this sustained high demand and recover from recent stockouts, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand volatility and mean. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $708.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14. Currently, the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P17-P26) is approximately 198.7 units per period, with the last 5 periods (P22-P26) averaging 197.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 864 units in-transit. The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods. Since the current demand regime (P14-P26) is stable but significantly higher than the initial history, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the post-shift period from P14 to P26) to ensure the base stock levels reflect the current high-demand environment and mitigate recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 is sustained: Average demand from P14 to P26 is approximately 189 units, a +105% increase from the P5-P13 average of ~92.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 14 and has stabilized at a higher level. Over the last 14 periods (P14-P27), the average demand is 187.7 units. The most recent 5 periods (P23-P27) show an average of 206 units. Despite recent stockouts (P25-P27 ending at 0 inventory), large orders placed in P24-P27 are in the pipeline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and ensure the OR backend captures this sustained high-demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14, which covers the entire duration of the new regime since P14. This provides enough data for variance estimation while focusing exclusively on the current high-demand state.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 14 and has maintained a much higher average compared to the start of the game. Over the most recent 10-period window (P19-P28), demand has averaged approximately 204.3 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently low (39 units), and while there is a significant pipeline of 751 units, the high and slightly volatile demand necessitates a consistent base stock calculation. The observed lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime while filtering out earlier, lower-demand data. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for approx 200+ units per period plus safety stock for the lead time + current period (L+1=5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 14 is maintained: P19-P28 (last 10 periods) average demand is 204.3 units, significantly higher than the initial regime (~110) or middle regime (~92).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally around Period 14. Since then, demand has significantly increased and stabilized at a much higher level compared to the start of the game. Over the last 10 periods (P20-P29), the average demand is approximately 202.6 units. The most recent 5 periods (P25-P29) average 204 units. To ensure the inventory covers the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5), I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=10 to capture this current high-demand regime while filtering for short-term noise. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as verified by recent arrivals. The current in-transit inventory is high (748 units), which the OR backend will subtract from the calculated base stock to determine the final order, preventing excessive over-ordering while maintaining high service levels for the regular chips.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 14, moving from a low of ~92 to a current stabilized average of approximately 204 units (as noted in Carry-over Insights for P29). Recent demands (P26-P30) are 188, 219, 213, 215, 215, further confirming a stable high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 50 units and a high pipeline of 785 units, we need to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). Using the last 10 periods (P21-P30) provides a robust average demand (~204.4 units) and standard deviation for this stable regime. This ensures we don't over-order while maintaining a high service level for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (critical fractile = 0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $708.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 14 and has maintained a much higher average. Over the most recent 10 periods (P22-P31), the average demand is approximately 209.6 units, with a notable spike to 276 in P31. The inventory currently sits at 0 on-hand, indicating that while arrivals have cleared previous backlogs, the system remains vulnerable to stockouts under this high-demand regime. Average lead time consistently matches the promised 4 periods. To stabilize service levels at this higher demand plateau and account for the recent volatility (215 to 276), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this stable high-demand period (P22-P31), which provides a mean of ~210/period. Increasing the base stock via recent statistics ensures the capped policy is less likely to under-order during peak periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 14 remains high: most recent 10 periods (P22-P31) average demand is 209.6 units with high volatility (max 276).

Daily Reward (R_t): $732.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P23-P32), the average demand is 211.2 units, compared to the earlier regime of ~92 units. Most recently, Period 31 saw a spike to 276 units, and the inventory is currently at 0 due to high demand exceeding arrivals. The lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods. To maintain a high service level given the high demand volatility and stockout history, I will use a 10-period window (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=10 captures the high-demand regime since its stabilization while providing enough data to smooth out recent spikes. This will ensure the base stock levels are high enough to cover the lead time plus current period demand (L+1) without over-ordering excessively as the pipeline inventory is quite high (936 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 14 is sustained: P23-P32 (last 10 periods) average demand is 211.2 units, with a notable peak of 276 in P31.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P24-P33), the average demand is approximately 208.5 units, with a notable peak of 276 units in Period 31. The lead time remains consistent with the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by all concluded orders arriving exactly 4 periods after being placed. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 58 units with 882 units in-transit. To ensure sufficient stock for the upcoming lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 10 to capture the current high-demand mean (~208.5 * 5 = 1042.5). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N of 10 to account for the increased volatility seen in this regime. These settings will help the OR backend maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand spike and provides a safety buffer against stockouts, which have occurred frequently in the past 20 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 14 remains stable and high: average demand over the last 10 periods (P24-P33) is 208.5 units/period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has consistently shown higher levels compared to earlier periods, with the average demand over the last 10 periods (P25-P34) currently at 202.1 units. While recent periods (P32-P34) show a slight cooling (averaging 179.7), the overall regime remains much higher than the historical mean. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrival notifications in the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 122 and in-transit is 797, totaling 919 units. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock targets needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10) captures the current high-demand state (~202/period), resulting in a base stock requirement around 1010 units. This allows the OR backend to place an order that fills the gap between current pipeline and the target, adjusted for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in the high-demand regime established at P14, though the most recent 3 periods (P32-P34) have softened to an average of 179.7 compared to the 10-period average of 202.1 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 14 remains operative, although demand softened slightly in Periods 32-34 before returning to 222 in Period 35. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P26-P35) is 207 units/period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 125 and a significant pipeline (735 units), the focus is on maintaining the high service level required for the current regime (profit $4 vs holding $1). I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods to reflect the stabilized high-demand regime, ensuring L+1 (5 periods) of coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $839.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-regime state since Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the average demand is 210.3 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 32 units. The most recent demand (P36) was 240 units, which is higher than the average, suggesting that the 'softening' mentioned in the P35 carry-over insight was temporary. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. With 121 units on hand and 739 units in transit, the pipeline is substantial. Setting N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations properly captures the current high-demand regime's mean (210.3) and volatility while excluding the older, lower-demand data points. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 5-period risk window (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in the high regime (P14-P36); the 10-period average demand (P27-P36) is 210.3 units, confirming the P14 shift is sustained despite periodic fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $673.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 14 remains high and stable. Analysis of the most recent 10 periods (P28-P37) shows an average demand of 211.6 units, which is consistent with the sustained high-demand regime noted since Period 14 (approx +100% vs initial levels). While there was a minor softening in demand between P32-P34, the last three periods (P35-P37) have rebounded to an average of 219.3. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods without deviation. I will use a 10-period lookback (recent_N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime's mean and volatility while smoothing out shorter-term fluctuations. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level capable of covering the expected ~1058 units required for the 5-period risk cycle (L+1), accounting for the current on-hand (111) and in-transit (817) inventory.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established at Period 14 is firmly sustained. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P29-P38) is approximately 196.7 units, and the last 3 periods average 202 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 91 units, with 855 units in transit (expected arrivals over the next 4 periods are roughly 163, 240, 264, and 188). Given the high service level requirements (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use a recent_N approach with N=10 to capture the current demand mean and volatility, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $601.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-regime state since Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), average demand has been 202.9 units. While there was a slight dip around P34-P35, demand remains significantly higher than the initial periods. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (e.g., P35 order arrived at P39). With on-hand inventory at 83 and in-transit at 846, the total pipeline is 929 units. Given the (L+1) exposure period (totaling 5 periods of demand), an average demand of ~200 units per period requires a base stock of roughly 1000 units. To maintain safety stock for the high-end fluctuations (P31 hit 276), I will continue using a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while ignoring the early lower-demand data. Lead time L is set to 'default' (4), which aligns with the observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P14 remains sustained: P30-P39 average demand is 202.9 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 14 is still active. Over the last 10 periods (P31-P40), the average demand is 205.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. This is consistent with previous carry-over insights indicating sustained high demand around 200-210 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P40 of the P36 order. Current on-hand inventory is 100, with a significant pipeline of 758 units. The OR backend will use the most recent 10 periods (P31-P40) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, effectively capturing the high mean and current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the current demand state while the pipeline inventory check prevents excessive over-ordering given the large amount already in transit.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-demand regime since Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), the average demand is 198.7 units per period, while the last 5 periods (P37-P41) average 207.2. Despite periodic fluctuations, the demand is significantly higher than the early game levels. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 138 and in-transit at 722 (total pipeline 860), and considering the lead time of 4 periods, we need the pipeline to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using N=10 for mu_hat provides a stable yet current estimate of mean demand (~199), resulting in a targeted base stock across the lead time. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to capture the observed volatility in this high-regime phase.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P33-P42), the average demand is 199.1 units per period, while the last 5 periods (P38-P42) average 201.8 units. The period lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P38 order in P42. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets an 80% service level. Currently, there is 107 units on-hand and 718 units in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this high-demand regime while smoothing out short-term fluctuations, and 'default' for L since the promised lead time of 4 is consistent with observations.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 14. Over the most recent 10 periods (P34-P43), the average demand is 198.8 units, while the full history of the high-demand regime (P14-P43) averages approximately 196.4 units. Although there are periodic fluctuations (e.g., P38-P39 and P43 seeing demand in the 170s, vs P36/P41/P42 in the 220s), the mean remains relatively stable around 200. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this current mean and variance, providing a robust estimate for the (L+1) period lookahead. On-hand inventory is 85 units, and lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Setting parameters to recent_N=10 allows the OR backend to maintain a high service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while accounting for recent demand volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P35-P44), the average demand is 202.9 units. The most recent demand (P44) was 208 units, consistent with this level. Although recent demand shows typical variability (ranging from 170 to 240), there is no evidence of a new regime shift. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across the entire history. With 29 units on hand and 822 units in transit, the pipeline is well-stocked. To maintain the target service level given the current regime's volatility, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current mean (~203) and volatility while filtering out older, lower-demand data from before Period 14.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the average demand is 201.4 units, which is consistent with the 'Period 40' carry-over insight indicating a mean around 202.9. The standard deviation over these last 10 periods is approximately 25 units. The lead time has remained exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46-P50), I need to ensure sufficient inventory to cover the remaining demand while accounting for the lead time. Since an order placed in P46 arrives in P50, this is the last highly effective order for the simulation. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the current high-demand stability. This will set the base stock level to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at a high service level, which the OR backend determines using the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1) ratio. This approach balances the risk of late-game stockouts against the cost of leftover ending inventory.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the average demand is 201.1 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.5. In the most recent 5 periods (P42-P46), the average is slightly higher at 203.0 units. Given the consistency of this regime, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the current mean and volatility while smoothing out minor fluctuations. The lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently low (29 units), but there is a significant pipeline (826 units) which includes recent large orders. The OR backend's service level logic (q = 0.8) will ensure we maintain a safety stock appropriate for this $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P38-P47), the average demand is 208.6 units, which is consistent with the long-term high-demand average of ~203 units since the shift occurred. However, the most recent 5 periods (P43-P47) show a slightly higher average of 211 units, and the game is approaching its final periods (P50 conclusion). Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, any order placed now (P48) will arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's horizon. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the current state. I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current high-demand mean and volatility, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained regime. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $832.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established at Period 14 continues to dominate, with demand consistently averaging around 200-210 units. Specifically, the average demand of the last 10 periods (P39-P48) is 204.6 units, and the last 5 periods (P44-P48) is 211.8 units. The game is entering its final period (P50 calculation will be the last after this P49 decision), meaning maximizing profit while clearing inventory is the priority. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since orders placed now (P49) will not arrive before the game ends (arrival would be P53), the OR backend decision for Period 49 primarily serves to align with standard policy, though final stock levels will be determined by the existing large in-transit pipeline (844 units) and on-hand inventory. I will use the most recent 10-period window (P39-P48) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it reflects the current sustained volatility and mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $892.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-demand regime since Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P40-P49), the average demand is 212.5 units per period. The most recent demand (P49) was 224, and the system is currently at zero on-hand inventory due to high demand. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P45-P49). Given that the demand has stabilized at this higher level with consistent volume, I will use a recent_N method with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand behavior (P40-P49) to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the high volatility observed in this regime. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P14 is stable: P40-P49 average demand is 212.5 units/period.
