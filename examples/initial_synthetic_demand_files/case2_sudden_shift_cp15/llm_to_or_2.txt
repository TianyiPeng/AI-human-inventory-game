Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the last 5 periods shows a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. With a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the critical ratio (q) is 0.8, meaning the OR backend will aim for an 80% service level. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since this is the first period and there are no detected regime shifts or calendar events provided, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (the full available history) to establish the baseline parameters. For the lead time L, I will use 'default' as we have no reason to doubt the promised 2-period lead time yet. mu_hat will be calculated by the backend as (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L)*std based on these 5 samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 141 units in-transit from the Period 1 order. Since the promised lead time is 2, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible in the Period 4 start. Historical demand is relatively stable across the provided pre-game data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the Period 1 demand of 108. The mean demand is approximately 110.8 units per period. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%. I will use 'default' parameters for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat as there is currently no evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime changes that would necessitate custom windowing or explicit overrides.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 67. History shows the Period 1 order (141 units) arrived in Period 2, indicating an actual lead time (L) of 1 period, whereas the promised lead time was 2. For Period 3, the order placed in Period 2 (137 units) is expected to arrive during the current period's resolution phase. Demand has fluctuated between 74 and 138 across pre-game and in-game history. The mean demand of the combined historical and game data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74] is approximately 105.6. I will set L to 1 based on the observed lead time. For mu_hat, I will use the 'default' method which calculates (1+L) * mean of all samples, providing a balanced forecast of 211.2 units to cover the lead time plus the current period's demand. Sigma_hat will also use 'default' to capture volatility across all available data points.

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following Period 3 demand of 119 units which exhausted the remaining 67 units of inventory. Historical demand for the first three periods was [108, 74, 119], with additional pre-game history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The total historical mean is approximately 107.25. Lead time observation: Period 1's order arrived in Period 2 (actual L=1), while the promised L is 2. The order from Period 2 (137 units) is currently in-transit and, if L=2, should arrive during Period 4 (visible in Period 5). The order from Period 3 (32 units) is also in-transit. Total in-transit is 169. Because we are currently stocked out and lead times have shown variance (actual 1 vs promised 2), I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend utilize the observed history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the full sample set) for demand and volatility to capture the most stable estimate of the 'Regular' chips demand profile, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $483.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 5. Historically, we have 5 demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (from provided history list) plus the 4 observed periods [108, 74, 119, 124]. Total 9 samples. Average demand is approx 109.1 units/period. The lead time has varied: Period 1 arrived in 1 period, Period 2 arrived in 2 periods. The promised lead time is 2. Currently, we have 13 units on-hand and 101 in-transit (this 101 likely refers to the sum of Period 3's 32 and Period 4's 69). Since demand is stable around 110, and L=2, the pipeline needs to cover 3 periods of demand (~330 units). The current inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 114, which is significantly below the required base stock. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the variability between 1 and 2 periods, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent mean of 103.8 (including the recent 124 and 119), ensuring the OR engine triggers a replenishment order to fill the gap.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0). The demand history shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [108, 74, 119, 124, 51] (in-game). The mean demand is approximately 103. The promised lead time is 2. Observed lead times were 1 period (P1 order) and 2 periods (P2 order). The P3 order (32 units) is currently overdue if we expect L=2, as it should have arrived in P5 (to be seen at P6 start); it is still 'In-transit'. This suggests lead time variability or potential loss. Total In-transit is 239 (P3: 32, P4: 69, P5: 138). Given the stockout and the inconsistency of arrivals, I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the observed lead time average. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent downward trend (74, 119, 124, 51) while balancing against the longer history, helping to avoid over-ordering if the P5 drop to 51 is a new trend, while maintaining enough stock for the L+1 window.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 11 periods (5 historical + 6 observed) shows a mean of approximately 100 units. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 124, 51, 67) has been volatile but averages lower (80.6). However, the primary concern is the supply chain. The P3 order (32 units) is now 2 periods overdue based on the promised lead time of 2, and the P4 order (69 units) is 1 period overdue. This suggests a shift in the actual lead time or potential lost shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 263 units are in-transit (P3: 32, P4: 69, P5: 138, P6: 24). To prevent further stockouts and account for the observed delays, I will set an explicit lead time of 3 periods. For demand, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent mean of ~89 units while smoothing out the volatility. The OR backend will use these to target a base stock covering (L+1) = 4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability detected: P3 order (32 units) and P4 order (69 units) are overdue; actual lead time appears to have shifted from 2 to at least 3+ periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $353.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 59 units on-hand and 242 units in-transit. Reviewing the history: the order from P3 (32 units) and P4 (69 units) have still not arrived. These are now 4-5 periods late, suggesting they are likely lost rather than just delayed, as orders from P5 and P6 have already arrived. The actual lead times observed have been 1, 2, 2, and 1. While the Carry-over insight suggests a shift to 3+, the arrival of P5 and P6 orders in P7 indicates the lead time is still volatile but averaging around 1.5-2 periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (which include the recent 1 and 2 period arrivals). Demand is fluctuating with a mean of ~100 over the last 7 periods (108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103). Given the high in-transit volume (242) relative to demand, and the risk of the 'lost' orders suddenly arriving, I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand and volatility to capture the full recent history while allowing the OR backend to maintain a buffer for the lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P3 (32 units) and P4 (69 units) are likely lost as subsequent orders (P5, P6) arrived in P7. Lead time remains volatile between 1-2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following Period 8's demand of 92 which exhausted the 59 units available. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) averages around 98 units (samples: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92). The promised lead time (L) is 2. Analyzing historical arrivals: P1 arrived in 1, P2 arrived in 2, P5 arrived in 2, and P6 arrived in 1. Orders from P3 (32 units) and P4 (69 units) are now 5-6 periods old and have not arrived despite later orders (P5, P6) concluding in P7; these are confirmed lost. In-transit inventory is 242 (likely P7's order of 141 and P8's order of 101, though the history shows 'ordered=0' for P8, the 'In-transit' count suggests a discrepancy or a large pending arrival from P7/P8). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average 1.5-period actual arrival time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (P4-P8) to capture the slightly lower recent demand volatility (avg ~87), ensuring the OR engine targets enough stock to cover the stockout while accounting for the lost units already flushed from the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of Period 3 (32 units) and Period 4 (69 units) shipments; lead time for successful deliveries fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods (mean 1.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains steady around a mean of 101 units over the last 9 periods. The observed lead times for successful deliveries have been [1, 2, 2, 1, 2] periods, resulting in an average lead time of 1.6 periods. As noted in previous carry-over insights, shipments from Period 3 (32 units) and Period 4 (69 units) are confirmed lost, as subsequent orders from Period 5, 6, and 7 have already arrived. Currently, on-hand inventory is 41 and in-transit is 116 (from Period 8 and 9 orders). The OR backend uses base_stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + z * sigma. With L=2 (promised), we need to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 300 units). Pipeline inventory (41 + 116 = 157) is below this. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand stability (avg 82.6, but history shows higher variance) and 'default' for sigma to ensure enough safety stock given the history of stockouts and lost shipments. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the 1.6 period average, providing a more realistic buffer than the promised 2 periods alone while accounting for the recent variability.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 10. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 10 periods is [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79], with a mean of approximately 91.7. Recent demand (last 3 periods) is slightly lower (avg 90.3). The lead time has been volatile, varying between 1 and 2 periods (P1: 1, P2: 2, P5: 2, P6: 1, P7: 2), and shipments from P3 and P4 are confirmed lost. The average observed lead time for successful deliveries is 1.6 periods. Since we must cover (L+1) periods of demand and the pipeline inventory is 202 (from orders in P9=15, P10=86, and a likely large order from P8 not listed but implied by the 'In-transit' jump), I will set L to 2 (promised) to be conservative against delays. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the full recent demand distribution while accounting for the recent slight dip in demand to avoid excessive holding costs, as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) suggests a service level target (q) of 0.8.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown moderate volatility, ranging from 51 to 124 over the last 10 periods, with the most recent demand being 122. Current in-transit inventory is 224 units (ordered in P9, P11, and P12), but the P9 order (15 units) is now overdue (3 periods passed), suggesting it might be lost, similar to P3 and P4. The actual lead time has been fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods for successful deliveries. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (which include 1s and 2s). For demand (mu_hat), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime (avg ~91 per period), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the observed variance. This approach ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the (L+1) period demand while accounting for the recent stockout in Period 11.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU chips(Regular) has 0 on-hand inventory and 276 units in transit (ordered in P10, P11, P12). History shows demand is relatively stable but inventory shortages are frequent due to lead time variability and historical losses (P3, P4). Recent demands (P8-P12) are [92, 100, 79, 122, 119], averaging 102.4 units. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (P1:1, P2:2, P5:2, P6:1, P7:2, P10:1). We assume an average lead time of 1.5 to 2. To ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock to cover demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1), I will use 'default' for L (which uses the promised lead time of 2) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility (approx. 102 units/period). This setting targets a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (~307 units), helping to recover from the current zero-stock position while accounting for the high in-transit balance.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status is 0 on-hand and 334 in-transit. Historically, shipments from P12 and P13 are still within the promised lead time of 2 periods. However, we've experienced stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods (P10, P12, P13) due to erratic demand and lead-time variability. Observed lead times have been 1 period (P1, P6, P10) and 2 periods (P2, P5, P7), with P3 and P4 orders confirmed lost. The recent demand (last 5 periods: 100, 79, 122, 119, 102) shows a slight upward trend compared to the earlier periods, averaging approximately 104 units per period. I am setting L to the promised 2 periods (default) to reflect the standard cycle, but setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent higher demand level of ~104/period, resulting in a base stock target covering 3 periods (L+1). This balances the need to recover from stockouts while accounting for the high volume currently in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~104 units/period (last 5 periods avg) compared to the initial 5-period avg of ~105, but with significant stockouts preventing actual sales data from reflecting true demand peaks.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. The current on-hand inventory is 90 units, and there are 121 units in-transit (orders from Period 14 and earlier). The demand has shown relative stability but suffers from censored data due to frequent stockouts; the recent demand (last 5 periods) averages approximately 114 units, slightly higher than the initial average. Historical demand sequence: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79, 122, 119, 102, 128]. Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P11 arrived in 3, P12 in 2, P13 in 1). Given this instability and the stockout risks observed, I will set L to 2 (the promised lead time), but use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current demand volatility and level more accurately than the long-term average, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level sufficient to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we faced a stockout (Ending Inventory 0, sold 90 units against 112 demand), despite starting with 90 units. The current status shows 0 On-hand inventory and 235 units In-transit (consisting of orders from Period 14: 5 units, and Period 15: 114 units, plus potentially unfulfilled/delayed quantities). The lead time history is highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a recent arrival (Period 14) showing a lead time of 3 for the P11 order. Because demand has remained relatively stable (recent average ~105-110) but supply is inconsistent, I am setting L to 2 (the promised lead time) as a baseline, but using recent_N for demand and volatility to capture the recent high-demand variance. Since we are at 0 stock, the OR backend needs to compute a base stock that covers the 2-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=3). Recent demand (P11-P15) averages 116.6 units, while the longer-term average is closer to 100. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat will target this higher recent demand to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: ranges from 1 to 3 periods (observed P14 arrival of P11 order). Period 15 stockout (90 sold/112 demand) indicates current base stock levels are insufficient for delivery delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 16 where demand spiked to 170 units (the highest recorded). The demand mean over the last 5 periods has risen to approximately 118 units, compared to the initial average of 105. Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~1.8). The in-transit inventory (264 units) consists of the P14 order (5 units, overdue) and the P16 order (143 units). To prevent further stockouts given the recent demand surge and lead-time instability, I am setting L to 2 (the promised lead time, which aligns closely with the observed average). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the higher demand regime, and an explicit sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (std of the last 5 demands is approx 27; sqrt(1+2)*27 \u2248 47).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 16: demand surged to 170 units; trailing 5-period average increased from ~104 to ~118 (+13%). Lead time continues to oscillate between 1-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand surged to 213, confirming a sharp upward regime shift that began in Period 16 (170). The trailing 2-period average is now 191.5, significantly higher than the previous 118 average. Additionally, the lead time remains highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (e.g., Period 14 and Period 17 arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With an in-transit pipeline of 414 units (including orders from P15, P16, and P17), we must ensure the base stock accounts for this higher demand level and lead-time risk. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 766 to reflect (1+L) * forecasted demand (4 * 191.5), using a conservative L=3 to account for the frequent delays. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat of 80 to account for the increased volatility during this demand spike and lead-time instability, ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough service level to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Major demand surge confirmed: Demand increased from ~104 to an average of 191.5 over the last 2 periods (+84%). Lead time volatility remains high with frequent 3-period arrivals.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observed a demand of 166 units, following a surge to 213 in Period 17 and 170 in Period 16. The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 183 units, confirming a significant regime shift compared to the previous baseline of ~104. Lead times remain highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Period 17 order arrived in 1 period, while the Period 14 order took 3). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to the stockouts in Periods 17 and 18. To account for the new demand level and the risk of 3-period lead times, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the surge and L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum observed lead time. This helps the OR backend maintain a higher safety stock to buffer against the combined effect of high demand and delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~104 to ~183 (+76%) over the last 3 periods (P16-P18). Lead time remains unstable, ranging between 1-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $897.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe a sustained high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) has been 170, 213, 166, and 231, averaging 195 units/period. This represents a significant shift from the previous average of ~104. Lead time continues to be highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Recent arrivals: P17-LT1, P18-LT1, but P16-LT3 for P14's order). Given the profit/holding ratio (4:1), the OR engine target service level (q) is 0.8. To account for the recent demand surge and the risk of 3-period lead times, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (~195 units/period) and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime. On-hand is low (27), and while in-transit is high (485), the target base stock needs to reflect the new mean (4 * 195 = 780) to prevent stockouts during delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed (P16-P19): Mean demand increased to 195 units/period (+87% vs baseline). Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The last 5 periods show demands of [170, 213, 166, 231, 198], resulting in a mean of 195.6. This is a substantial increase from the initial baseline of ~105. We are currently in a stockout state (ending on-hand inventory = 0), and demand remains consistently high. Lead time is highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a recent arrival at lead time 1 (P18 order arrived in P19), but Period 20 conclude shows no arrivals. Given the critical need to capture this high demand regime and the risk of 3-period lead times, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but will rely on the recent_5 regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=5 for mu_hat captures the current high-demand average (~196) which, when multiplied by (1+L=3), allows the OR backend to target a base stock of ~588. This should help recover from the current stockout and provide a safety buffer against the observed lead time variability.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, increasing from a baseline of ~104 to an average of ~195 units per period. The last 5 periods of demand (P17-P21) are 213, 166, 231, 198, and 193, averaging 200.2 units. We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an observed average of approximately 1.7 periods across successful deliveries. Because of the recent stockouts and the high demand level, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the new demand level (avg ~200). I am setting L to 2 (the promised lead time) as the base, which, combined with the OR backend's (L+1) logic, will target 600 units (3 * 200). With 733 units already in-transit (orders from P19, P20, and P16/P21 nuances), the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to bridge any gap between the base stock and the pipeline. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 will provide a localized volatility estimate for the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift fully confirmed: Mean demand for P17-P21 is 200.2 units/period, representing a 92% increase from the initial baseline.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 23. Demand context: A significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 16/17. Demand has stabilized at a much higher level, with the last 7 periods (P16-P22) averaging 193.1 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~105. The last 5 periods (P18-P22) average 192.8 units. Lead time context: Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average ~1.7). There are likely lost shipments (P3, P4, and potentially P16, as its 143 units have been outstanding for 7 periods). Inventory Status: On-hand inventory is currently high (298 units) due to the arrival of 474 units in Period 22 (from P19 and P20 orders). Combined with 259 units in-transit, the total inventory position is 557 units. I will set L to 'default' (2) to align with the promised lead time while accounting for the look-ahead period. mu_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the high-demand regime since Period 16. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime. This allows the OR backend to maintain a base stock that covers the elevated demand while managing the holding cost of the current surplus.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, stabilizing at a much higher level. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P19-P23) is approximately 208.2 units, which is consistent with the 'Carry-over Insight' of ~200 units/period. Lead time remains highly volatile, oscillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.0). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (55) relative to the new demand levels, but there is a substantial 'In-transit' quantity of 315 units. To ensure the OR backend captures this new high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering the shift from P17 onwards) to capture the higher mean (~204) and sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility in this period. L is set to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average of observed lead times, which accounts for the frequent 3-period delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: average demand increased from ~104 to ~208 units/period (+100%) based on P19-P23 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift around Period 16, moving from a baseline of ~105 units to a high-demand state. Over the last five periods (P20-P24), demand has averaged 201 units, which is consistent with the sustained 100% increase noted in the carry-over insights. However, the system is currently struggling with stockouts (ending inventory was 0 in P24), and on-hand inventory is depleted. The lead time remains highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (observed P19 arrived in P22, L=3; P20 arrived in P22, L=2). Since the promised lead time is 2, but 3-period arrivals are frequent and lead to stockouts, I will use an explicit lead time of 2.2 to provide a small buffer for the backend's base-stock calculation. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N with N=9 to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime (P16-P24), which yields an average of ~198 units/period. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=9 to capture the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level. The high 'In-transit' quantity (536) suggests that the OR backend's capped policy is already attempting to catch up with the surge, so providing accurate mean and volatility parameters for the current regime is critical to prevent future stockouts once these shipments arrive.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the demand for chips(Regular) remains in the high-volume regime established around Period 16. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is approximately 198 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~105. Recent demand observations (P23: 243, P24: 195, P25: 185) support maintaining this higher forecast. Lead time continues to be volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P23 order arrived in 2 periods, while P22 order was skip-period/empty, and P19 took 3 periods). The pipeline inventory is currently high (619 units), comprising orders from P24 (221 units) and P25 (139 units). However, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the high demand and arrival timing. To stabilize the service level against a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1 (q=0.8), I am using N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing recent volatility. For lead time, I'll use the 'calculate' method to allow the backend to use the full history of observed lead times, acknowledging the 1-3 period variance. Sigma_hat is set to the last 10 periods to reflect the increased variance associated with the higher demand mean.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has stabilized in a high regime (approx. 196 units/period) since Period 16. The most recent demand samples (P22-P26: 176, 243, 195, 185, 188) average 197.4, confirming this shift. Lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. Notably, the order from Period 16 (143 units) is significantly overdue (11 periods) and is likely lost, similar to the losses in P3 and P4. The 619 units currently 'in-transit' likely include these lost shipments (P3, P4, P16) which total 244 units, meaning actual active pipeline inventory is approximately 375 units (P24: 221, P25: 139). To compensate for the high stockout risk seen in Period 26 (0 inventory) and the unreliable lead times, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture the full high-demand regime and L to 2 to represent the mode of successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Confirmed likely loss of Period 16 shipment (143 units) as it is 8 periods past the maximum observed lead time of 3; demand regime remains stable at ~196 units/period (P16-P26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $874.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we observe an on-hand inventory of 2 units with 403 units reported in-transit. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, the in-transit balance is likely inflated by the lost Period 16 shipment (143 units). Adjusting for this, active pipeline units are approximately 260 (from P25 and P27). Demand has stabilized in a high regime since Period 16; the average demand from Period 19 to 27 is 202.0 units per period. The actual lead time has been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2). For Period 28, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the stable high-demand period from P19-P27) to capture the current mean demand of ~202. I will set L to 2 (the promised lead time and approximate average) and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect current volatility. This configuration aims to maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.8) while accounting for the significant increase in demand compared to the initial baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P19-P27 confirmed stable at ~202 units/period, roughly double the initial baseline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 200 units/period (mean of last 5 periods: 200.0). Lead times remain highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with several recent deliveries (Period 24, 25) taking 3 periods. To avoid frequent stockouts as seen in Period 28 (on-hand dropped to 0), I will set the lead time parameter L to 2.2 (representing an average including the delays) to ensure the base stock covers at least 3.2 periods of demand (L+1). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture the entirety of the current high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Sigma_hat is set to the default to capture the variance of this specific period. The pipeline inventory (497) is high, so the OR backend's capped policy will moderate the actual order size to prevent excessive holding costs while attempting to recover from the Period 28 stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable at approximately 200 units/period (P16-P28 avg: 199.2). Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with a notable frequency of 3-period arrivals (P24, P25).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the demand regime is stable at approximately 200 units/period (P16-P29 average is ~199). However, we have an immediate stockout (On-hand: 0) and high lead time volatility (1-3 periods). Recent arrivals (P24 arriving in P27, P25 arriving in P28) confirm that lead times are frequently hitting 3 periods. To ensure high service levels and account for this volatility, I will use L=3 for the base stock calculation. For demand, I will use the last 14 periods (N=14) to capture the stable high-demand regime starting from P16. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=14 to reflect the current regime's variance. The pipeline inventory is high (717 units), which includes the order from P28 (238 units) and P29 (220 units), so the OR backend's capped policy will moderate the final order to avoid excessive holding costs while trying to recover from the current stockout.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable data (Periods 19-30), the average demand is 205.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts in Periods 29 and 30 due to lead-time variability. Observed lead times recently have been 3 periods (P24, P25 orders) and 1 period (P27 order). Because of the stockout and the high 'In-transit' balance (840 units), which includes orders from P16 (likely lost), P28, P29, and P30, I will set mu_hat using the last 12 periods (P19-P30) to capture this higher mean accurately. L is set to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the average observed lead time (which is approx 2.0 based on history), providing a buffer against the 1-3 period volatility observed. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=12 to reflect the volatility in this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P19-P30 confirmed stable at ~206 units/period. Continuous stockouts in P29-P30 highlight that lead-time fluctuations (1-3 periods) require high safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $922.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we observe that demand in Period 31 spiked to 276 units, the highest recorded so far. While the previous stable mean was ~206, the last 5 periods (P27-P31) average 226.8, suggesting a possible upward drift or higher variance. Lead time remains volatile, with the last three arrivals showing 3, 2, and 3 periods (P28, P29 arrivals). Current on-hand is 182, and we have 123 units in transit (ordered P30). Pipeline inventory is relatively low (123) considering the high demand and lead time uncertainty. To prevent further stockouts like those seen in P29-P30, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for frequent delays. mu_hat is set using the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture the high-demand regime since P16 while smoothing the recent P31 spike. sigma_hat is also set to the last 15 periods to provide sufficient safety stock for the observed 1-3 period lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Period 31 reached a record 276 units; the 5-period moving average has risen to ~227 units (+10% from the previous 206 baseline). Lead time of 3 periods is now a frequent occurrence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $625.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, demand was 186, following a record high of 276 in Period 31. The demand regime from P16 onwards remains significantly elevated compared to the start. The 5-period moving average is now ~227, while the average since the major shift (P16-P32) is approximately 204. Lead times continue to be highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being common (P28, P29 were 3 and 2 respectively, P30 was 2). To account for this instability and the recent demand spike, I am using recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L). Specifically, I'm setting N=17 for mu_hat to capture the entire high-demand regime since P16, and N=10 for lead time to capture the recent frequency of 3-period arrivals. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand and the frequent delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: High-demand regime since P16 is sustained, with a recent 5-period average of ~227 units/period. Lead-time remains volatile (1-3 periods), with 2 and 3-period arrivals occurring frequently in the last 5 observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand was 182 units, and we ended with 0 on-hand inventory. The demand regime from P16 onwards remains high, but recent periods (P31-P33) show increased volatility (276, 186, 182). The 5-period moving average is approximately 213 units. Lead time continues to be highly unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with 3-period arrivals (P28, P29) occurring recently. To account for this, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers the longer end of the observed lead-time range and current period's demand. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N with N=18 to capture the entire high-demand regime since Period 16 (avg ~206). For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent increase in volatility (Standard Deviation of P29-P33 is ~39.4). This combination aims to build sufficient safety stock to handle both the 100% demand increase since the baseline and the frequent 3-period delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P33 is stable at ~206 units/period, but short-term volatility has increased (P31 peaked at 276). Lead time is frequently hitting 3 periods (observed in P31, P28, P27).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the inventory state is critical: 0 units on-hand and 845 units in-transit. Demand analysis shows a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 16. The most recent 5-period average (P30-P34) is 206 units/period, while the average since P16 remains approximately 204 units. Period 31 saw a significant peak of 276 units, indicating high volatility. Lead time is highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; notably, orders from P32, P33, and P34 are currently in transit. Given the frequent 3-period lead times and current stockout, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to ensure the base stock calculation (1+L) covers the full delay risk. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=19 (covering the regime from P16 to P34) to capture the shifted mean of ~204 units. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=19 to account for the increased volatility in this higher demand period, ensuring the OR backend provides sufficient safety stock to mitigate the frequent lead-time induced stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $855.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, on-hand inventory is 33 units. The demand regime remains stable in the high-demand state established around Period 16, with a recent 10-period average (P26-P35) of approximately 210 units. However, short-term volatility is high, with demand reaching 276 in P31 and 222 in P35. Lead time continues to be highly unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with 3-period arrivals occurring frequently (P31, P35). To address this, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest observed delay. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime since P16 while smoothing out the volatility. For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N=20 to ensure the safety stock captures the increased variance observed in this higher demand state. The in-transit pipeline of 600 units is substantial (covering roughly 3 periods of demand), but given the lead time of 3 and potential for lost orders (as seen previously in P3, P4, and P16), maintaining a robust base stock is necessary to avoid the frequent stockouts observed between P29-P34.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P35 remains stable at an average of ~206 units/period, with high short-term volatility peaking at 276. Lead time frequency of 3 periods is significant (observed in arrivals at P31 and P35).

Daily Reward (R_t): $901.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level starting from Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (P19-P36), the mean demand is approximately 206.5 units per period. While there was a spike in P31 (276), recent demand remains within the 170-240 range. To compute mu_hat, I am using N=18 (P19 to P36) to capture this established high-demand regime while smoothing out short-term volatility. Lead time remains unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; recent arrivals (P35, P36) confirm lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum observed lead time, preventing the frequent stockouts seen in previous periods (P29, P30, P33, P34). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=18 to reflect the increased variance in this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P19-P36 is stable at an average of ~206.5 units/period. Lead time frequency of 3 periods remains a significant risk for stockouts.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stabilized at a mean of approximately 206.5 units/period, but significant volatility exists, with demand peaking at 276. Period 37 ended with 0 on-hand inventory due to a lead-time delay (nothing arrived in Period 37). Lead times are highly unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a high frequency of 3-period arrivals (e.g., P35, P31, P28). To prevent stockouts during these 3-period lead-time stretches, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. I am using recent_N (N=22) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime that began at Period 16, which provides a more accurate forecast than the full history while maintaining enough samples for statistical significance.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 864 units in-transit. The demand regime has remained stable at an average of approximately 206.5 units per period since Period 19. Recent demand (P31-P38) shows higher volatility with a peak of 276. Lead times are highly unstable, frequently reaching 3 periods (observed in arrivals at P31, P35, and P36). Currently, orders from P35 (10 units), P36 (225 units), P37 (254 units), and P38 (51 units) are in-transit. Given the high stockout frequency due to 3-period lead times, I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. For mu_hat, I'll use a recent_N of 20 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime (starting around P19). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N of 20 to account for the increased volatility seen in the latter half of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P19-P38 remains stable at ~204 units/period, with high volatility (peak 276). Lead time of 3 periods is a frequent and significant disruptor, occurring in ~40% of recent successful deliveries.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40, the product 'chips(Regular)' remains in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. The average demand since Period 19 is approximately 204.6 units. Period 39 concluded with a significant arrival of 530 units (from orders in P36, P37, and P38), resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 359 units. The lead time continues to be volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a 3-period lead time occurring frequently (~40% of recent successful arrivals). To account for this instability and prevent stockouts seen in earlier periods (like P38), I am setting the lead time (L) to 2 (the promised value, but the backend will use this in conjunction with pipeline data). For mu_hat, I'll use a recent window (N=21, covering the start of the high-demand regime at P19) to capture the current mean of ~205 units/period. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=21 to capture the significant volatility observed during this regime, ensuring the OR backend calculates a sufficient safety stock to buffer against both demand spikes (like P31's 276) and frequent 3-period delivery delays.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system has 141 units on-hand and 334 units in-transit. The demand regime has been stable since Period 19, with an average demand of approximately 204 units per period. However, lead time remains highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (observed in P36 and P31 arrivals). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the target service level is 80%, but with current lead-time instability, maintaining a higher 'effective' base stock is necessary to prevent stockouts. The last five demand observations (P36-P40) average 200.2 units. I will use recent_N (N=22, covering the high-demand regime since P19) to set mu_hat, ensuring the OR engine accounts for the sustained shift to ~204 units/period. For lead time, I will set L=3 explicitly to protect against the frequent 3-period arrival pattern which has caused previous stockouts.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system had 141 units on hand but faced a demand of 226, resulting in a stockout and 0 ending inventory for the start of Period 42. Currently, there are 585 units in transit (ordered in P41 and presumably P40/P39 if any remained). Looking at the demand history since the regime shift at Period 16, the average demand is approximately 205 units/period. Recent volatility has seen peaks of 276. Lead times are highly unstable, frequently hitting 3 periods (e.g., Period 36 order arrived in P39, lead time 3). To prevent stockouts caused by these 3-period lead times, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for a longer pipeline. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the last 25 periods (N=25, covering P17-P41) to capture the high-demand regime, which averages ~205 units/period. Sigma_hat is set to the same period to capture the significant variance seen in this high-demand phase, ensuring sufficient safety stock for demand spikes and delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable since P16 with a mean of ~205 units/period. Lead time frequency of 3 periods is significant and remains the primary driver of stockouts; accounting for L=3 is necessary for availability.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current state is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 following a demand of 219 in Period 42. There are 835 units in transit, but none arrived in the last two periods. Historical analysis confirms a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a stable mean of approximately 205 units/period (P16-P42 avg \u2248 204.6). Recent demand has shown high volatility with peaks up to 276. The primary challenge is lead time instability, which frequently hits 3 periods (observed in P39, P35, P31). To prevent the recurring stockouts seen in P41 and P42, the OR parameters must account for a lead time (L) of 3 to ensure the 'base stock' covers a longer protection interval (L+1 = 4 periods). I am setting L explicitly to 3. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (post-P16) while smoothing out recent noise. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=20 to ensure the safety stock accounts for the significant demand variance observed in this high-volume period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 75 units on-hand with 627 units in-transit (including the likely lost P16 shipment of 143 units and recent orders from P42 and P43). Demand has stabilized at a high regime since P16, with a mean of approximately 205 units/period. The most recent demand (P43) was 176, but the average from P19 to P43 is approximately 204.5. Lead time continues to be volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (as seen in P31, P35, P39). To ensure availability and maximize profit ($4/unit vs $1/unit holding cost), I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent delays. For mu_hat, I am using a recent window of 25 periods (starting from the regime shift at P19) to capture the current high-demand mean of ~204.5 units/period. Sigma_hat is also set using this recent window to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the 3-period lead time plus the review period demand, protecting against the observed lead-time instability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the inventory was exhausted (0 ending inventory) due to a demand of 208 units against a starting on-hand of 75. Currently, in Period 45, on-hand inventory is 0. There are 791 units in-transit, including orders from P42 (250 units), P43 (43 units), and P44 (164 units). Since P42 (ordered at P42) has not arrived by the start of P45, its lead time is at least 3 periods. The 'Carry-over Insights' consistently show that a lead time of 3 periods is a frequent occurrence and a major driver of stockouts. Therefore, I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the (L+1)=4 period risk window. Demand has been stable in a high-regime state since P16; the average demand from P19 to P44 is approximately 205.7 units. I will use a recent_N of 25 to capture this sustained high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which provides enough samples to account for recent volatility (like the 276 peak) while maintaining the 206 mean.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Lead time of 3 periods remains a frequent reality (P42 order still in transit at P45 start). Demand regime since P16 is confirmed stable at ~206 units/period with standard deviation around 30-40 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 698 units in-transit. The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 206 units/period and high volatility (standard deviation ~35-40). Recent lead times have frequently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; notably, the Period 42 order (250 units) is still in transit as of Period 46 (3 periods elapsed), while the Period 44 order arrived in just 1 period (Period 45). To protect against stockouts caused by this lead-time instability (L=3), I am setting L to 3 and using the recent 30 periods (since the regime shift at P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high-demand state and the risk of 3-period delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Lead time of 3 periods remains a frequent reality (P42 order still in transit after 3 periods). Demand regime since P16 is confirmed stable at ~206 units/period with standard deviation around 35-40 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 205 units/period. Recent data (P41-P46) shows demand consistently around this level (226, 219, 176, 208, 204, 208). The lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. Notably, the order from Period 42 (250 units) is still in transit as of the start of Period 47, confirming a lead time of at least 5 periods or a lost shipment, though 3 periods remains the most frequent 'maximum' for successful deliveries. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 786 units in-transit (P42, P43, P44, P46). To prevent stockouts caused by lead-time variability, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers the maximum observed reliable lead time. mu_hat is set using recent_N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (avg ~205). sigma_hat is set to explicit=40 to reflect the volatility observed (std dev ~35-40).

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Order from Period 42 (250 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting a potential loss or extreme delivery delay, significantly exceeding the previous 3-period maximum.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the system is in a critical state with 0 on-hand inventory and a potential loss of the Period 42 order (250 units), which is now 6 periods overdue (double the previously observed maximum lead time of 3). Demand has remained stable in a high-regime state since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 206 units/period. Over the last 5 periods (P43-P47), the average demand is 205.4 units, and the standard deviation is approximately 20.3. However, lead time is the primary source of risk. Recent successful deliveries show lead times of 1 or 2 periods (P44, P45), but 3-period lead times are historically frequent (~40%). Given the high probability that the P42 shipment is lost, the OR engine needs to compensate for the missing pipeline. I will set L=3 to account for the frequent delays and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=32 (covering the stable high-demand regime since P16) to ensure the base stock is calculated against the correct demand distribution. Setting L=3 explicitly forces the OR backend to maintain a higher inventory level to buffer against the ongoing lead-time volatility and the current deficit.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Period 42 order (250 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost; lead-time volatility (1-3 periods) remains high and is the primary driver for safety stock requirements. Demand remains stable at ~206 units/period.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are at the penultimate period of the game. The current inventory status is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 862 units in transit. Historical analysis confirms that the demand regime has been stable since Period 16, averaging approximately 206 units per period. Crucially, the order from Period 42 (250 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is confirmed lost. Recent lead times for successful deliveries have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure availability for the final period (Period 50) while considering the significant pipeline (862 units), I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed reliable lead time) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the risk of delays. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=32 (covering the stable high-demand regime since P16) to capture the true mean of ~206. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=32 to reflect the observed volatility (approx. 35-40 units) of this regime. This configuration allows the backend to calculate a base stock that should be satisfied by the existing large pipeline, likely resulting in a small or zero order to avoid excessive ending inventory and holding costs at the game's conclusion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $636.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 206 units per period. Recent data (P44-P49) confirms this, despite stockouts. The Period 42 order (250 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is confirmed lost based on the 3-period maximum observed lead time. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a 3-period lead time (observed in Period 49 for the Period 46 order) being a frequent occurrence. Given this volatility and the recent history of stockouts, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest reliable delivery window. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=34 to cover the entire stable high-demand regime since Period 16. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=34 to capture the high volatility (approx 35-40 units) seen in this regime. This approach will increase the base stock and safety stock to mitigate the impact of 3-period delivery delays and the zero on-hand inventory at the start of Period 50.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of Period 42 shipment (250 units); Lead time of 3 periods remains a frequent and critical driver for inventory planning, necessitating an L=3 assumption for safety stock.
