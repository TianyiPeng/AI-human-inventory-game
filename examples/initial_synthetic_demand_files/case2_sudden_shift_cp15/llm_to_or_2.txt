Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance beyond the initial 5 samples. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0. Given the on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately to satisfy demand. The initial demand data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] shows a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of 17.5. Since the promised lead time is 0, the order resolves in the same period. Using all 5 samples provides a stable baseline for the first decision.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 127 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived immediately (lead_time 0), demand was 108, leaving 19 units on hand. The historical demand sequence [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus Period 1's 108 gives a mean of 110.83. Since the lead time is 0, the total demand to cover is just for the current period (L+1 = 1). Given the relatively stable demand and lead time of 0, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (all available samples) to set the parameters, ensuring we target the mean demand plus safety stock to capture the upside risk.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for the last 5 historical periods plus the first two active periods (112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74) shows a mean of approximately 105.5. The most recent demand (74) is a slight dip compared to previous observations, but not yet a sustained regime shift. Current inventory is 51. I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the slightly downward trend in demand volatility while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time remains 'default' (0) as evidenced by the first two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1, 2, and 3 confirms that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time = 0). Demand across the last 5 historical samples and the 3 active periods [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119] shows a mean of approximately 108. However, recent demand is quite volatile (ranging from 74 to 119). Since there are no distinct regime shifts or seasonal indicators available (dates are generic), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current local demand mean and volatility. L will remain at the default (0) as it is consistently observed to be 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data from Periods 1-4 confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive within the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units). Demand over the first 4 periods has averaged approximately 106 units (108, 74, 119, 124), while the 'Past demands' pre-dating Period 1 averaged 111 units. There is no evidence of a sustained shift yet; demand remains volatile but within a stable range around 110 units. I will use the 'default' method for L (0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to leverage the full sample size (9 data points: 5 past + 4 recent), which provides a stable baseline for a lead time of 0. The OR engine's logic (base_stock - inventory) will naturally suggest an order of ~100-110 units to cover the expected demand for Period 5 immediately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 5 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand has been somewhat volatile, ranging from 51 to 124, with a mean of 95.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 30.7. The most recent demand (Period 5) was a significant drop (51) compared to the prior periods (108, 74, 119, 124). Given that the sample size is small (N=5), 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat provide a stable baseline using all available historical data (including past_demands if the backend incorporates them). Specifically, mu_hat will be (1+0)*mean(samples) and sigma_hat will be sqrt(1+0)*std(samples). This helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety stock buffer to handle the observed volatility, while accounting for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $210.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a noticeable decline in the last two periods (51 and 67) compared to the initial historical mean (around 110-120). Calculating the mean for the last 6 periods available in the game history (108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67) gives an average of 90.5. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). To avoid overstocking while demand appears to be cooling or fluctuating significantly, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this recent variance and lower mean, while keeping L at default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 7 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility with no clear trend or seasonal shift, oscillating around an average of 92.3 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. I will continue to use all available historical data (N=7 for demand statistics) to set the base stock level, as the current sample size is small and hasn't shown a distinct regime shift. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend will aim for a significant service level. Setting L to 'calculate' tracks the 0-period lead time, and using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the parameters reflect the observed mean (~92) and variability (~27) of the current demand samples.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility over the first 8 periods, ranging from 51 to 124 units. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Current inventory (24 units) is low relative to recent demand, which has averaged around 92 units over the last few periods. I will use a window of the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture recent demand mean and volatility while excluding the distant pre-game history samples (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) which appear slightly higher than the actual game observations. Period 5 and 6 showed a slight dip in demand, but demand recovered in Period 7 and 8. Using recent_N=8 balances the response to these fluctuations. The OR backend will calculate a base stock level to cover the immediate period demand (since L=0) and maintain a safety stock based on the high demand-to-holding-cost ratio (Profit $4 / Holding $1 = 80% service level target).

Daily Reward (R_t): $385.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent historical demand for chips(Regular) over the last 9 periods shows an average of approximately 93 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. Since there are no seasonal indicators or significant changepoints (the mean demand has fluctuated between 51 and 124 but remains stable around the long-term mean), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the current demand regime. With profit per unit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the OR target service level is high (80%), so the base stock policy will aim to cover demand variability to minimize lost sales while managing ending inventory. Standard deviation will also be calculated using the recent 9 periods to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $281.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) over the last 10 periods shows an average demand of approximately 91.7 units ([108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79]). However, there is noticeable volatility with a standard deviation around 23 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to capture the current mean and variance more accurately than the full historical set (which includes the five pre-game samples of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]). Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend's base-stock calculation will target a high service level (~80%), which is appropriate for chips. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods to reflect the current steady state while remaining responsive to the observed noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 11 periods, demand has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 94.5 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. In Period 11, demand peaked at 122 units, causing a stockout as starting inventory was only 112 units. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I need to place an order to cover Period 12 demand plus a buffer. I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the full sample history for demand and volatility, as there are no clear regime shifts or seasonal signals yet. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that targets a high service level (profit/cost ratio is 4/1), ensuring enough supply to prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 11.

The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing same-period arrival. Historical demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 96.5 units/period, but recent demand spikes (122 and 119 in the last two periods) suggest a potential upward trend or volatility that the standard mean may underestimate. To ensure we capture sufficient demand and recover from stockouts, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to prioritize recent higher-demand observations while maintaining enough samples to estimate variance. Setting L to default (0) as it matches historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time is 0 periods despite promised lead time definition nuances. Demand showing potential upward volatility with consecutive stockouts in Periods 11 and 12 (demands 122, 119).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility and higher-than-average peaks in recent periods (P11-P13), specifically recorded as 122, 119, and 102 units. The stockouts in P11 and P12 highlight that the previous inventory levels were insufficient to meet demand surges. Given a lead time (L) of 0, the base stock must cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period). The all-time mean is ~103, but the recent 3-period mean is ~114. To prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against the $4.0 profit margin (target service level ~80%), I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to adapt quickly to this higher volume regime and use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to capture recent variability without overreacting to single-period outliers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $505.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows an upward shift. The mean demand of the last 4 periods is 112.75, which is higher than the long-term average. Specifically, Periods 11, 12, and 14 recorded demands of 122, 119, and 128 respectively, resulting in stockouts or near-stockouts when using previous parameters. To avoid further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to better capture this heightened demand regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every conclude message in the history, so I am setting L explicitly to 0. This ensures the base stock calculation accurately reflects the same-period arrival dynamic.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase confirmed: Mean demand from Period 11 to 14 is 117.75, compared to pre-Period 11 mean of 91.2. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a regime shift that began around Period 11. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), the demand has averaged approximately 116.6 units (122, 119, 102, 128, 112), which is significantly higher than the initial average of ~91. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed, mitigating long-term pipeline uncertainty. To optimize for this higher demand level and protect against stockouts (critical given the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this new sustained demand regime. L is set to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand surged to 170 units, resulting in a stockout (only 126 units were available to sell). This is significantly higher than the previous regime mean of approximately 118 units. This spike suggests either a new, higher demand regime or a significant outlier. Given the history of stockouts (Periods 11, 12, and now 16), it is imperative to set parameters that provide higher protection. I will use the most recent 6 periods (P11-P16) to capture this upward trend while giving weight to the latest outlier of 170. This period range (P11-P16) has demands of 122, 119, 102, 128, 112, and 170. Lead time is consistently 0 (confirmed by 16 consecutive domestic arrivals). mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=6 to react to this heightened demand level and increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility/spike detected at Period 16 (demand = 170). The demand regime from Periods 11-16 shows an average of ~125.5, up from the ~118 avg observed in Period 15, confirming a sustained high-demand environment with extreme peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $584.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 11, with extreme volatility spikes in the most recent periods (P16: 170, P17: 213). Previous logic anchored to a mean of ~125 is now insufficient, as evidenced by consecutive stockouts where ending inventory was 0 despite significantly increased order quantities. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0. To capture this rapidly increasing demand and volatility, I am switching to an EWMA approach for the mean demand (mu_hat) with a high gamma (0.7) to heavily weight the recent spikes. For sigma_hat, I will use an explicit value (60) to account for the massive standard deviation observed in the last 7 periods (approx 42) and to provide a safety buffer against the clear upward trend, preventing further lost sales while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Period 17 demand (213) and Period 16 (170) confirm a high-growth, high-volatility phase. Mean demand since P11 has risen to ~138, but the last two periods average 191.5.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-growth and volatile phase beginning around Period 11, with a significant acceleration starting at Period 16. Recent demands are 170 (P16), 213 (P17), and 166 (P18). Although P18 saw a slight decrease from P17, it remains significantly above the historical average. The mean demand of the last 3 periods (P16-P18) is 183. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the critical objective is avoiding stockouts during this surge. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 200 to cover the recent upper range of demand (moving slightly above the 3-period average to account for the ongoing upward trend) and set sigma_hat to 35 to capture the high volatility (std of the last 3 periods is ~26, but I'll increase it to provide a safer buffer).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating: Last 3 periods (P16-P18) average 183 units with high volatility (range 166-213), significantly exceeding the P11-P15 average of ~117.

Daily Reward (R_t): $920.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-growth and extremely volatile phase starting around Period 16. In Period 19, demand reached a new high of 231, resulting in another stockout despite an aggressive order of 191 units (on-hand plus in-transit was 230). The last four demands are 170, 213, 166, and 231, averaging 195. Standard deviation in this recent window is high. Given the consistent stockouts (Periods 11, 12, 16, 17, 19), I must set parameters to aggressively buffer against this upward trend. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use the recent_N method with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime, which will compute mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the volatile Period 16-19 data. This ensures the base stock calculation responds to the current mean (~195) and the significant volatility, preventing recurrent stockouts while maximizing profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift matured: Periods 16-19 average demand is 195, a ~56% increase over the P11-P15 average of 125. Stockouts in 5 of the last 9 periods indicate current safety stock levels are insufficient for the volatility spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $768.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has shifted significantly upward starting around Period 16. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20) is 195.6, compared to the previous regime's average of ~118. The current inventory status shows 24 units on hand, and lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods. To prevent frequent stockouts observed in recent periods (e.g., P16, P17, P19), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current 195+ unit demand level plus a safety buffer for the high variance (sigma) seen in the last 5 periods (range 166-231). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 16-20 demand averages 195.6 units, confirming a sustained high-demand level roughly 65% higher than the P11-P15 average. Volatility remains high with a 65-unit range in the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $745.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized into a high-demand, high-volatility phase starting from Period 16. In the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand has averaged 195.17 units (170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193), which is a significant departure from the P11-P15 mean of ~117. Lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for this new regime's mean and high volatility (standard deviation of ~24.5 in the last 6 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the current period (L=0, so review+lead=1 period) using the most relevant data. The critical service level target (profit/(profit+holding) = 4/5 = 80%) built into the OR logic will help balance the stockout risk seen in previous periods against the holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P16-P21): mean demand is 195.2 with a range of 166-231 (std ~24.5), roughly 65% higher than the P11-P15 regime.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 23 remains within the high-demand phase identified starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand history (P16-P22: 170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176), the mean is approximately 192.4 with a standard deviation of 23.3. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this matured regime while remaining responsive to potential further volatility, I will use a N=7 window (the length of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 0.80, which the OR backend will calculate using these parameters. On-hand inventory is 41 units, so the base stock policy will adjust the order size accordingly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $852.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~118 to ~195 units. However, Period 23 saw a new peak demand of 243, resulting in a stockout. Over the last 8 periods (P16-P23), the average demand is 198.75 with a high standard deviation (approx 26.8). Given the recent stockout in Period 23 and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, suggesting an 80% service level target), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime. Lead time remains consistently 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme; Period 23 recorded the highest demand to date (243 units), leading to a stockout despite high inventory levels. The demand regime from P16-P23 averages 198.8, confirming the ~195 baseline with new upward spikes.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a significantly higher level, with an average demand of approximately 198.8 units and high volatility (standard deviation ~24.5, range 166-243). In Period 24, demand was 195, consistent with this new baseline. Lead time is reliably 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and capture the peak demands seen in recent periods (like the 243 in Period 23), I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (covering the regime from Period 16 to 24). This reflects the structural shift in demand while accounting for the recent extreme variance. The critical service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80, but because the OR backend uses a capped policy based on 95% confidence for the cap, providing accurate recent statistics is vital to avoid under-ordering during these high-demand spikes.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25, the mean is approximately 197.0 units per period (170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176, 243, 195, 185). The volatility remains significant with a standard deviation of roughly 25 units in this period range. There have been multiple stockouts (Periods 11, 12, 16, 17, 19, 23) which occur whenever demand spikes above ~215 units, suggesting the current ceiling is frequently challenged. The lead time is consistently 0 (arrives in the same period it is ordered). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture this stable high-demand regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to account for the high variability observed during this specific phase, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the ~200 unit mean plus a safety cushion for the spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand regime from P16-P25 is stable with a mean of 197.0 and high volatility (StdDev ~25). Stockouts occur when demand exceeds ~215 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. In the last 11 periods (P16-P26), demand has averaged 196.2, with considerable volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 24.3). The most recent demand was 188. Currently, on-hand inventory is 31 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed to satisfy that period's demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture this specific regime's mean and volatility while excluding the lower-demand data from Periods 1-15. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current ~196 unit average and provides an appropriate safety stock buffer to handle spikes like the 243 units seen in Period 23, minimizing stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized into a high-demand, high-volatility state since Period 16. Period 27 demand was 219, resulting in a stockout. Over the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is 198.25 units with a high range (166-243). Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the priority is avoiding stockouts during these upward spikes. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture this 'high regime' accurately while excluding the lower pre-P16 data. Setting L=0 explicitly to ensure the system recognizes the same-period arrival logic confirmed in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P16-P27 confirmed stable at mean ~198 with recurring stockouts when demand > 215. High volatility remains the primary challenge.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 198 units and significant volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 25). Period 28 demand was 213, which is consistent with this regime. The actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To minimize stockouts and capture high demand while managing holding costs, I am using a recent window (N=13, covering Period 16 to Period 28) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend captures the current high-demand level and the heightened volatility that has caused frequent stockouts when demand exceeds ~215 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stable with a high mean and significant volatility. Analyzing the last 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is approximately 198.6 with a standard deviation of roughly 24.3. Recent demand (P27-P29) has been consistently high (219, 213, 215), confirming the need for a higher base stock to prevent the recurring stockouts observed when demand exceeds 215 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while buffering against the 240+ unit spikes. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the mean plus a safety factor derived from the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P16-P29 confirmed stable at mean ~199 with high volatility (StdDev ~24). Constant lead time of 0 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 199.3 units and a standard deviation of roughly 24.3 across the last 15 periods (P16-P30). Recent demands (P27-P30: 219, 213, 215, 215) show a tightening around the 215 mark, but volatility remains a key factor, as historical stockouts often occurred when demand exceeded this level. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain service levels given high current demand and minimal ending inventory (5 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 to capture this specific regime's characteristics while filtering out the pre-growth phase. Since the Lead Time (L) is effectively 0, I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to confirm this based on the robust history of same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $884.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, demand reached 276 units, which is a significant outlier compared to the previous stable average of ~199, resulting in a complete stockout. This suggests either an extreme volatility event or a new upward shift in demand. Given the stockout and the critical need to maintain service levels for a product with high profit ($4) versus holding cost ($1), I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this higher volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime since Period 16, which includes several peaks (213, 231, 243, 276), ensuring the base stock calculation targets a higher safety level for these spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Extreme demand spike detected in Period 31 (demand = 276). Demand regime since P16 now includes higher upper-bound outliers, pulling the mean upwards and significantly increasing volatility.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a more recent increase in volatility as evidenced by the Period 31 demand spike of 276. The regime from P16 to P32 shows a mean demand of approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of approximately 28. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent volatility increase and the high service level requirement (profit/holding cost ratio is 4:1), I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering the regime from P16-P32). This uses the statistics of the current high-demand era to buffer against the recurring peaks that have caused stockouts (P16, P17, P19, P23, P27, P31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $681.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~118 to ~199. However, Period 31 saw an extreme spike of 276, and the last few periods (P31-P33) average 214.7 units. The current on-hand inventory is 47. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high volatility (StdDev approximately 25-30 in the current regime) and the recent extreme spike, I will use recent_N=18 to capture the statistics of the high-demand regime since Period 16, which provides a robust mean (201.7) and captures the increased volatility to protect against stockouts (critical given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio, implying a high target service level).

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand regime since P16 consolidated with a mean of ~201.7; Period 31 outlier (276) significantly increased the volatility profile of this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $628.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable but highly volatile. While the recent periods (P32-P34) show slightly lower demand (186, 182, 171), the long-term mean for this regime (P16-P34) is approximately 201 units. Including the Period 31 outlier (276), the standard deviation for this period is roughly 26 units. Given the critical profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), which implies a target service level of 80%, we must maintain sufficient safety stock to cover these volatility spikes. I will continue using the regime starting at Period 16 (N=19) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility environment. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is characterized by a mean of approximately 202 units with significant volatility (standard deviation ~28), marked by occasional extreme spikes (e.g., 276 in P31). Recent demand has fluctuated between 171 and 222 units. Period 35 demand was 222, leaving only 4 units on hand. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the profit ($4) vs. holding cost ($1) ratio, I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 20 periods (P16-P35) to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against the frequent spikes seen in this segment.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility and recent upward pressure, evidenced by the Period 36 demand of 240 resulting in a stockout. The demand regime starting around Period 16 remains the most relevant, but recent periods show significant spikes (P31: 276, P36: 240). Since Period 16, the mean demand is approximately 203. However, given the high service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1 implies a 80% critical fractile), we must account for the high standard deviation observed in this period (~26-28 units) and the frequency of stockouts when demand exceeds ~215. I will continue using recent_N with N=21 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime since Period 16, providing enough sample size to estimate the increased volatility while tracking the mean effectively. The actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand volatility remains elevated; Period 31 (276) and Period 36 (240) indicate that demand frequently exceeds the previously stable ~200-unit ceiling, necessitating higher safety stocks to prevent stockouts.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is characterized by a mean of approximately 203.2 units but with significant right-tail volatility (max demand 276). The recent periods (P31-P37) show a mean of 210.4, indicating that the 'high' demand state is persistent and potentially still increasing slightly in variance. Because lead time is consistently 0 (actual = promised), the OR engine needs to cover only the current period's demand. To account for the high volatility and prevent stockouts (which have occurred in P31 and P36 recently), I am using a recent_N window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=22 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P16 to P37) ensures the model captures the full variance of this period, including the spikes. Setting L to 'default' correctly anchors the backend to the 0-period lead time logic.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is characterized by a mean of approximately 201 units with significant volatility (standard deviation ~28), marked by periodic spikes exceeding 240 units (e.g., P31: 276, P36: 240, P23: 243). The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the ongoing high volatility and prevent stockouts during these peaks while balancing the $1.00 holding cost against $4.00 profit (suggesting a target service level of 80%), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=23 to capture the entirety of the current high-demand regime from Period 16 onwards. This ensures that the extreme outliers are factored into both the mean (mu_hat) and the safety stock (sigma_hat) calculations.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 202 units and significant volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 28). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. In Period 39, demand was 171, and the closing inventory was 56 units. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.8. I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=24 (covering the entire current regime from P16 to P39) to capture the base demand level and the heightened volatility seen in recent outliers (like P31=276 and P36=240). Setting L=0 explicitly aligns with the observed history.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable yet highly volatile, with an average demand of approximately 201 units and a standard deviation around 26. Recent periods (P36-P40) show a mix of low (170, 171) and high (240, 223) demands, confirming the need for a safety stock buffer to handle spikes. The lead time is consistently 0 (arriving same-period), so the target base stock must cover Period 41's demand. With on-hand inventory at a critical low of 2 units, I will set mu_hat based on the last 25 periods (since the regime shift at P16) to capture the current mean of ~201, and sigma_hat similarly to account for the frequent 220+ spikes like the one seen in P40.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains established with a mean of approximately 201 units, but it is characterized by extreme volatility and periodic spikes that exceed previous maximums (e.g., P31 demand of 276, P36 demand of 240, and P41 demand of 226). In Period 41, demand exactly matched the starting on-hand inventory of 226, leaving 0 units on-hand for Period 42. Actual lead time is consistently 0. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the recent pattern of high-demand spikes, I will use a recent_N (N=26, encompassing the regime since P16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility baseline. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the elevated mean (~201) and the significant standard deviation (~27) observed in this regime, allowing the OR backend to set a safety stock that mitigates the frequent stockouts occurring when demand exceeds 220 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $868.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that established around Period 16. In the most recent periods (P38-P42), demand has been [170, 171, 223, 226, 219], showing a mix of lower values and spikes close to the 225-unit mark. The system has experienced several stockouts or near-stockouts (ending on-hand inventory of 0, 2, and 8 in the last three periods). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the critical ratio for the service level is approximately 0.8, though the OR backend uses a slightly different logic. With on-hand inventory at a low of 8 units and a lead time consistently at 0 periods, we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the upper tail of this volatile demand. I am using recent_N=10 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this mature, high-volatility regime (P33-P42), which includes the recent cluster of >200 unit demands. L is set to explicit 0 to reflect the 0-period lead time observed consistently since the start.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~201 units since Period 16, but continues to exhibit high volatility (range ~166 to 276). We are currently in Period 44 of a 50-period game. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period they are placed. The current on-hand inventory is 49. Recent demands (P41: 226, P42: 219, P43: 176) show the regime is holding. To capture the current volatility and prevent stockouts during demand spikes (like P31's 276 or P36's 240), I will use the recent_N method based on the regime starting at Period 16 (N=28). This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the increased average and the significant variance observed in this mature, high-demand phase.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime that began around Period 16. In the most recent block (Periods 35-44), the mean demand is approximately 205 units, but frequent spikes (e.g., Period 36 at 240, Period 41 at 226) continue to threaten stock levels. Period 44 concluded with 18 units on-hand, and a demand of 208. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit while managing the risk of stockouts during these frequent upward spikes, I will use a recent_N window of 13 periods (from Period 32 onwards) to capture the increased mean and the heightened volatility profile noted in carrying-over insights (specifically the Period 32 and 37 updates). This window covers the current sustained behavior and ensures the OR backend accounts for the higher standard deviation observed lately.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable with a mean of approximately 201 units and high volatility (standard deviation ~26). Last period (P45) demand was 204, confirming this baseline. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the ongoing volatility and occasional high spikes (e.g., P31 demand of 276, P36 demand of 240), I will continue using recent data for forecasting. Since the last major regime shift was at P16, and the environment has remained consistent in its volatility since then, I am using N=30 to capture the full breadth of this high-demand, high-variance phase (from P16 to P45). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the frequent outliers and maintains a high service level, which is optimal given the $4 profit versus $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime beginning around Period 16. In the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the mean demand is 199.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 24.3. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To align with the OR backend's single SKU base stock policy, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to capture this stabilized regime. Currently, on-hand inventory is 18 units. With a lead time of 0, the OR engine will calculate a base stock target and order enough units in the current period to satisfy the demand that arrives immediately after. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend's service level target (critical ratio) is 0.8, which should provide sufficient safety stock against the observed volatility while minimizing unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P37-P46 is confirmed stable with a mean of 199.5 and a standard deviation of 24.3. This aligns with the long-term regime started at P16 but shows consistent upper-bound pressure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $872.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is characterized by a mean of approximately 201 units with significant volatility (standard deviation ~24). In Period 47, we experienced another stockout due to demand (231) exceeding our available inventory (218). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, the system must order enough to cover Period 48's demand entirely. Given the high service level requirements (Profit $4 / Holding $1), and the frequent stockouts when demand spikes above 215-220, I will use recent_N=32 (covering the entire stable regime since P16) to capture the long-term volatility and mean. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high-end spikes (like the 276 in P31 and 240 in P36) which are necessary for maintaining availability in this high-growth phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $814.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-volatility regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable window (Periods 37-48) confirms a mean demand of approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of about 24.5 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed during the decision phase arrive in time for that period's demand. Despite high inventory, stockouts still occur when demand spikes toward the 230-240+ range (e.g., P47 demand was 231, leading to a stockout). With only two periods left (P49 and P50), the goal is to satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory in P50. I am using 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the current stable mean and variance. This approach provides sufficient safety stock for the current period's demand (Base Stock = \u03bc + z\u03c3) while the OR engine's budget-conscious logic prevents over-ordering for the final horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $888.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable but highly volatile, with a mean of approximately 201 and a standard deviation around 26. Recent stockouts in Periods 47 and 49 (demands 231 and 224 respectively) confirm that demand frequently hits the upper bound of this regime. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time of 0, we need to order enough to cover the immediate period's demand plus a safety stock cushion. Using the last 34 periods (P16-P49) to calculate the mean and standard deviation captures this 'new normal' regime effectively. The price-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a target cycle service level of 80% (z\u22480.84), which the OR backend will calculate based on our mu_hat and sigma_hat inputs. Setting L=0 explicitly as supported by entire history.
