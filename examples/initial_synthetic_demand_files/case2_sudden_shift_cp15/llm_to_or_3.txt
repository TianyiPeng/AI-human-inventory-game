Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The past demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows five data points: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The mean demand is 111.4 units with a standard deviation of 17.2 units. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have no inventory (0 on-hand, 0 in-transit), we need to set parameters that trigger an order covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using all available historical samples (N=5) is appropriate for the initial mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. I will use the 'default' method for L to align with the promised lead time and 'recent_N' for mu and sigma to focus on the limited provided history.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 141 units was placed. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we expect this order to arrive in Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 (demand was 108). Historical demand data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus Period 1 demand of 108 shows a stable pattern with a mean of approximately 110. Since it's very early in the game (no arrivals yet), I will use 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand/volatility to capture the most recent samples including the user-provided history and Period 1 demand (Total N=6). The goal is to build up inventory to meet future demand given the 4-period lead time delay.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Evaluation of the history shows that orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 have not yet arrived. Given the promised lead time (L) of 4, the Period 1 order (141 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be reflected in the Period 6 start observation. Current on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0 and no same-period arrivals occurred (L is clearly > 0). The historical demand sequence [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus recorded demands in Period 1 (108) and Period 2 (74) suggest a mean demand of approximately 105. Since we are in the very early stages (N=2 for recent observations), I will use 'default' or 'recent_N' for demand parameters to establish a baseline. mu_hat needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The OR backend will handle the base_stock calculation. I'll stick to the promised lead time L=4 for now as no data yet contradicts it.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 are still in transit, as expected (Period 1's order is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's resolution phase and will be visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for Periods 1-3. Historical demand for the last 5 samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (from prompt) and game history [108, 74, 119] shows a mean of approximately 107. Since we have only 5-8 data points and no clear regime shift or seasonal calendar dates provided, I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4 periods) and the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand volatility while the pipeline fills. This ensures the OR engine targets a base stock covering (4+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 should arrive during Period 5 (after this decision phase) and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no shipments have arrived yet, which is expected given the lead time. High historical demand (mean ~111.4 over 5 samples + 5 past demands) suggests we must maintain a strong pipeline. The 570 units in-transit correspond exactly to the sum of orders from P1-P4 (141+137+146+147). I will use 'default' for L to stick with the promised lead time of 4. Since the demand is relatively stable but showing a slight upward trend in the last few periods (119, 124), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent volatility and mean without overreacting to early noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on 'Period 5 conclude', the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (promised lead time is 4). No orders have been lost. Current demand data for the first 5 periods are [108, 74, 119, 124, 51], with the pre-game samples being [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The mean demand of all 10 samples is roughly 103.3. There is a noticeable drop in Period 5 (demand=51), but it's too early to call it a regime shift. I will use the default lead time (4) and defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat using all available historical data to maintain stability while we await more arrivals and demand signal consistency.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory situation is stabilizing as the first orders (placed in Periods 1 and 2) have arrived, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some fluctuation: the initial average was high (around 110-120), but the last two periods (Period 5 and 6) showed significantly lower demand (51 and 67). I will monitor if this represents a new lower regime. For now, I'll use a recent window (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent demand drop against the earlier high demand, while keeping the lead time method at default as the observations align with the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game) was [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], averaging ~111. Demand from Period 1 to Period 7 has been [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103], averaging ~92. There appears to be a slight downward shift or higher variance recently, but no definitive long-term regime change yet. Arrivals from Periods 1, 2, and 3 have confirmed the lead time is exactly 4 periods as promised (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 192, which consists of the order from Period 4 (147 units) and Period 6 (45 units). Period 4's order is expected to arrive during the current Period 8 (visible in P9). I will use L=4 (default), and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the demand behavior since the simulation started, which better reflects the current mean (~92) compared to the initial samples. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed from P1, P2, and P3 orders).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The carry-over insight confirms the lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 98.4 units over 13 samples (8 available in game history, 5 pre-game). Recent demand (Periods 5-8) shows a slight decrease (avg 78.25) compared to earlier periods (avg 106), but the sample size is small. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=8) to capture the trend of the active game periods while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N to reflect current volatility. With On-hand inventory at 258 and In-transit at 165 (orders from P6 and P8), the pipeline is healthy. The OR backend will compute the base stock for (L+1)=5 periods to ensure coverage for the lead time plus the review period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $242.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Based on historical data from periods 5, 6, 7, and 8, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. In Period 9, no arrival was expected as no order was placed in Period 5. The current on-hand inventory is 158 units, with 253 units in-transit (from orders in periods 6, 8, and 9). Historical demand samples are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100] (in-game). The demand appears stable around a mean of approximately 98 units per period. I will use the 'default' lead time (promoted 4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=9 to capture the full in-game history while acknowledging the slight variance in recent periods. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $192.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable demand pattern with a mean of 91.7 units over the last 10 periods (range 51-124). Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6 orders all arrived exactly at L=4). P5 and P7 had 0 orders, which explains the gap in arrivals in Period 9. P8, P9, and P10 orders (totaling 309 units) are currently in-transit. On-hand inventory is 124 units. To ensure coverage for the L+1 window (5 periods), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the current demand regime. The target inventory level needs to account for the pipeline (309) and the on-hand (124). The OR backend's base-stock calculation will optimally balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost based on these statistical parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $486.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is critically low (2 units) after a high demand of 122 in Period 11. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in successful deliveries for orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6). The order from Period 5 was zero, explaining why there were no arrivals in Period 9 and Period 11 (the latter following the 0 order from P7). We expect the Period 8 order (120 units) to arrive during Period 12. Historical demand from the last 11 periods shows a mean of ~94.4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to reflect the full game history mean and variance, ensuring the base stock level (for L+1=5 periods) accounts for this demand. This will help the OR backend calculate an order that replenishment the pipeline and maintains the 80% service level target (implied by Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with an average around 101 units over the last 12 periods. The latest demand (Period 12) was 119. On-hand inventory is very low (3 units), but the pipeline is substantial (394 units). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, and P8 all arrived in exactly 4 periods). Based on transition timing, we are expecting the orders placed in P9 (88 units) to arrive in P13, and P10 (101 units) in P14. Since the lead time is robustly confirmed as 4, I will use L=4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=12) to capture the long-term stable average of approximately 101 units per period, scaled by (1+L) = 5. For sigma_hat, I'll use the recent history to capture current volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has been stable. Over the last 13 periods, the mean demand is approximately 100 units (96.9 per period). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 13. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 437 units in-transit. A stockout occurred in Period 13 (sold 91 against demand of 102). With L=4, the base stock must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~500 units). Total pipeline inventory (437) is slightly below the target base stock. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the current demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets approximately 500 units for the pipeline + on-hand balance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $404.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown a slight upward trend in recent periods (mean of last 5 is ~114 vs. lifetime mean of ~101). Promised lead time (4) is consistent with observed arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P8, P9, P10 all arrived with lead_time=4). 
Inventory Check: We have 424 units in transit (ordered in periods 11, 12, 13, and 14). Specifically, the order from P11 (70 units) is expected to arrive during the execution of P15, and P12 (135 units) during P16.
Demand Analysis: Recent demand samples are [79, 122, 119, 102, 128]. There is no clear external calendar context, but current demand is higher than the early periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this moderate shift while maintaining stability. The OR engine needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Setting L to 'default' (4) and using recent demand trends will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the stockout risk (Profit/Holding ratio is 4:1) and current pipeline levels.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand reflects a mean of approximately 104 units per period (last 5 periods: 122, 119, 102, 128, 112). On-hand inventory is currently 0, which has led to lost sales in the last three consecutive periods (P13, P14, P15) because arrivals were insufficient to meet demand. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met as seen in 'conclude' messages for orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P8, P9, P10, and P11. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. mu_hat is set to roughly 104 * 5 = 520. Since demand is relatively stable but inventory is depleted, I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high stockout risk recently observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $540.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has significantly increased, with the last 4 periods showing demands of 102, 128, 112, and 170 (average ~128), compared to the overall historical mean of approximately 105. There is clear evidence of stockouts in Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16, where units sold were limited by on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0, I must set parameters to aggressively replenish stock and account for this higher demand regime. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike while maintaining the promised lead time L=4. This will target a base stock level that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the new higher average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 13: Average demand increased from ~100 to ~128 (+28%), leading to sustained stockouts through Period 16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $524.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 13. Average demand before Period 13 was approximately 97 units. From Period 13 to 17, demand has spiked significantly (102, 128, 112, 170, 213), averaging ~145 across those 5 periods, and trending upwards sharply in the last two (170, 213). We have been stocked out for 5 consecutive periods because orders placed under the previous demand regime are insufficient for current volumes. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further lost sales, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated demand and volatility of the new regime. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is currently reliable. mu_hat will represent (1+L) * average of the last 5 periods (~145 * 5 = 725), ensuring the base stock level is lifted to meet the higher demand trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift confirmed: Mean demand increased significantly from Period 13, rising from ~100 to an average of ~170 in the last 3 periods (P15-P17) with a peak of 213 in P17.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting from Period 13. While earlier demand averaged around 100, the last three periods (P16-P18) have shown demands of 170, 213, and 166, respectively (average ~183). This surge has caused consistent stockouts since Period 13, with current on-hand inventory at 0. To recover service levels and account for the 4-period lead time, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the higher demand regime (Periods 13-18). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated over (1+L) = 5 periods to cover demand until the next possible replenishment arrives.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is experiencing a significant demand surge that started around Period 13 and has intensified in recent periods. Demand from Period 17 to Period 19 was 213, 166, and 231 respectively (average of 203.3). The current inventory state is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have experienced consecutive periods of lost sales because arrivals are consistently smaller than current demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since (L+1) = 5, the OR backend needs a mu_hat covering the expected demand over the next 5 periods. Using the most recent 5-period average (P15-P19) which is approximately 190.4 units/period, I set mu_hat = (1+4) * 190.4 = 952. sigma_hat is adjusted using recent_N (N=7 to capture the volatile shift) to ensure a higher service level during this growth phase. The goal is to maximize total reward by aggressively ordering to meet the new demand level and recover from the on-hand stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified: Average demand from P17-P19 reached 203 units/period, significantly higher than the previous P13-P16 shift level (~128).

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted upwards, with the most recent four periods (P17-P20) showing demand values of 213, 166, 231, and 198 (average ~202). This follows a previous shift from ~100 to ~130. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has consistently exceeded arrivals, which were based on older, lower demand estimates. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. To recover from sustained stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new high-demand regime of ~200 units/period. Over the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, this leads to an expected demand of ~1010. The OR backend will subtract the in-transit inventory (855) and order the remaining amount required to reach the target base stock, subject to the safety stock and cap logic. This aggressive approach is necessary to restore service levels and capture the $4/unit profit while on-hand inventory is exhausted.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a clear high-demand regime that began around Period 17, with demand levels consistently hovering around 200 units (P17-P21 mean: 200.2). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to sustained demand exceeding past deliveries, though a large pipeline of 892 units is in transit to address this. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (Period 17-21) to capture this stabilized high-demand level (mean \u2248 200, so mu_hat = (1+L)*200 = 1000). Setting L to 4 based on consistent historical arrivals. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=5 to reflect the recent volatility within this high-demand stage. These parameters will ensure the base stock levels are high enough to eventually clear the backlog and maintain service levels once the pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~200 units/period (mean of P17-P21 is 200.2).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level compared to the start of the game. Since Period 17, the average demand is approximately 195 units per period (P17: 213, P18: 166, P19: 231, P20: 198, P21: 193, P22: 176). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in P14 through P18. Currently, there is a small on-hand inventory (45 units) and a large pipeline (826 units), which matches the aggressive ordering strategy of recent periods to catch up with the demand surge. To maintain this higher service level while accounting for the detected demand shift, I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods (P17-P22) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current stable high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat reflects ~195 units/period across the (L+1) horizon.

The recent high demand of 243 in P23 confirms this sustained shift. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in 10 of the last 11 periods, indicating a critical need to maintain high inventory levels and use recent data to set parameters. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P19 order arrived at P23). I am choosing N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current stable high-demand regime (starting P17) and using N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this period range. This will set a base stock level sufficient for (L+1) periods of high demand to recover from the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at ~200 units/period based on P17-P23 history (mean 202.8).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new high-demand regime that began around Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 202 units per period (P17-P24 mean: 201.3). The previous period (P24) saw a demand of 195, continuing this trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent arrivals (P20 order arrived P24). With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the service level is approximately 80%. Given the established stability of this new regime over the last 8 periods, I am using recent_N with N=8 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current mean (~200) and variance of the high-demand state rather than the lower historical average, while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 200 units per period starting from Period 17. Analyzing the most recent nine periods (P17-P25), the average demand is 200.44 with a standard deviation of approximately 22.3. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. Recent inventory management has improved, moving from sustained stockouts to maintaining positive ending inventory in P22, P24, and P25. With a critical service level of 0.8 (Profit $4.0, Holding $1.0), setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) will provide a responsive yet stable forecast for the current demand level. The in-transit inventory is high (775 units), which the OR backend will use to calculate the gap to base stock.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 200 units per period starting from Period 17. Over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), the mean demand is 208.8 units. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (P5 through P26) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 66 units with 794 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory includes orders from P23 (155), P24 (249), P25 (216), and P26 (174). The P23 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 27 decision cycle. To ensure sufficient stock for the L+1 window (5 periods) given the stable high-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current mean (~209) and volatility accurately. This N covers the stable period since the last major shift while providing enough data for a robust sigma estimate.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 17 and has stabilized at a new higher plateau. The mean demand from Period 17 to Period 27 is approximately 197 units per period (sum of demands: 213+166+231+198+193+176+243+195+185+188+219 = 2207 over 11 periods). The promised lead time (L) of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrival patterns in the game history. At the start of Period 28, on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), while in-transit inventory is high (818 units). To maintain service levels in this high-demand regime, I will use recent history (N=11) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, effectively covering the (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on this mean of ~197 and subtract the pipeline inventory (818) to determine the next order, ensuring we don't over-order despite the stockout risk.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at approximately 200 units per period starting from Period 17. Over the last 12 periods (P17-P28), the mean demand is 201.7 units. The current state (Period 29 start) shows 38 units on-hand and 797 units in-transit. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Since the shift to a ~200 unit/period regime is well-established (12 periods of data), I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this stabilized higher demand and its associated volatility. This setting (L=4, mu_hat over 5 periods of demand) will guide the OR backend to maintain sufficient base stock to cover demand during the lead time and the current period, preventing the stockouts observed in the transition phase.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 17. Analyzing the last 13 periods (P17-P29), the mean demand is 202.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.5. This confirms the carry-over insight of a regime shift to ~200 units/period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent arrivals (P25 order arrived in P29, L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 39 units and in-transit is 798 units. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. To capture this stabilized regime and provide sufficient buffer against stockouts (critical given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I will use the last 13 periods (recent_N=13) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the ~200 demand level while accounting for the current volatility.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable at approximately 200 units per period since Period 17. Over the last 14 periods (P17-P30), the average demand is 203.4 units with consistent volatility. The latest period (P30) showed a demand of 215, resulting in a minor stockout (2 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the regime is stable, I will use recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand profile (approx 200/period) while ignoring the lower demand seen in the first 12 periods. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $716.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant increased volatility and a potential new regime shift over the last few periods. While the previous stable mean was ~200, the last two periods recorded demands of 215 and 276. Period 31's spike to 276 suggests either a seasonal peak or a new upward trend. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory due to this demand surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit ($4.0) vs holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level is high (80%), so I will use a shorter window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike and ensure enough stock is ordered to recover from the stockout. This approach (averaging periods 27-31) results in a mean demand of approximately 227.6 units/period, which more accurately reflects the current high-demand environment than the long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime upward shift or spike detected: Mean demand for P27-P31 increased to 227.6 (+12% vs previous ~202 mean), peaking at 276 in P31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $702.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an upward trend recently. While the stable regime from Period 17-26 was around 202 units, the mean demand from Period 27-32 has increased to 217.3 units, with a peak of 276 in Period 31. This suggests a potential structural shift or a sustained seasonal spike. To ensure adequate service levels and prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 30 and 31, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=6 (covering Periods 27-32) to capture this higher demand average. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=6 to capture the increased volatility (Std Dev \u2248 31 for this window). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals, so 'default' is used for L. The backend will calculate the base stock using these parameters to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/spike confirmed: Period 27-32 mean demand increased to 217.3 units (+7.5% vs previous 202 mean), with significant volatility (high 276, low 186).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a higher level compared to the early periods of the game. Based on carry-over insights and recent history (P27-P33), the mean demand is approximately 212 units per period (P27: 219, P28: 213, P29: 215, P30: 215, P31: 276, P32: 186, P33: 182). While there was a significant spike in P31 (276), the most recent two periods (P32-P33) have seen demand soften to the 180s. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime which includes the P31 spike and the subsequent normalization, ensuring sufficient buffer for the (L+1) horizon. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, which I will continue to use via the default method.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime tracking: P27-P33 mean demand is 212.3 units, representing a sustained shift from the earlier ~200 level, despite a slight softening in the most recent two periods (P32-P33).

Daily Reward (R_t): $560.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a recent period of volatility. The shift observed starting around Period 27 (mean ~212) has softened in the most recent three periods (P32: 186, P33: 182, P34: 171), bringing the average back toward the previous stable regime of ~200 units/period. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P27-P34) is 205.8, while the mean for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 206, and the mean for the last 3 is 179.6. Given this downward trend but considering the recent spike to 276 in P31, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current level while accounting for the recent variability. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 124 and a large pipeline of 839 units, the backend needs to maintain a base stock that accounts for (1+L) periods of demand (~1030 units total) to avoid over-ordering as the pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand from P27-P34 is 205.8, showing a return toward the ~200 level after a brief spike in P31.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~200 units per period following a temporary spike in Period 31. The mean demand for the most recent 9 periods (P27-P35) is 207.7 units, and specifically for the last 4 periods (P32-P35) it is 190.25 units, indicating a return to the long-term stable level of ~200. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current stable mean while incorporating the recent volatility. The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 119 and in-transit is 769 (covering orders from periods 32, 33, 34, and 35), which is sufficient to cover the lead time pipeline given the current demand rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $808.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained increase and stabilization around the 200-210 range, with recent periods (P35-P36) showing slightly higher demand (222, 240). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P27-P36) is 212.0 units, while the more recent 3-period average is 211.0 units. Given the trend and the need to maintain service levels while accounting for the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, I am choosing N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's volume and volatility (std dev for P27-P36 is ~31.8). This ensures the base stock calculation, which covers L+1 (5) periods, is grounded in the most relevant recent history. On-hand inventory is healthy at 152, and 721 units are in-transit, which aligns with expected arrivals over the lead time. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime tracking: P27-P36 mean demand is 212.0 units, showing a sustained higher level compared to the earlier ~200 baseline.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 27. The mean demand from Period 27 to Period 37 is approximately 211 units. Although there was a spike to 276 in Period 31, recent observations (P32-P37) show demand fluctuating between 171 and 240, with a mean of 199.5. To prioritize stability while accounting for the overall higher level since P27, I will use recent_N with N=11 (tracking from P27 onwards). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P33 order arriving in P37). The current pipeline is healthy at 782 units, and the backend OR logic will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers (1+L) periods of demand at the optimal service level (q = 4/5 = 0.80).

Daily Reward (R_t): $545.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 12 periods (P27-P38) with a mean of approximately 207 units and a standard deviation of roughly 30. Recent demand (P34-P38) shows values of 171, 222, 240, 196, and 170, maintaining an average close to this baseline but with moderate volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by historical arrivals. I will use a recent_N of 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime. The on-hand inventory is 135 and in-transit is 812, totaling 947 units. Given a lead time of 4, the inventory needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). At a mean of 207, the estimated mu_hat (1+L)*mean is 1035. The current pipeline of 947 is slightly below this, and with a high service level target (critical ratio 0.8), the backend will trigger a supplementary order to ensure availability while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~207 units/period (mean of P27-P38 is 206.6) with moderate volatility (std ~30).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~207 units/period over the most recent regime (P27-P39). Although there was a brief spike in P31 and P36, the last three periods (P37-P39) have seen lower demand (196, 170, 171), bringing the recent average closer to the long-term stable level of ~200-210. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 111, with 820 units in transit. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use the recent_13 method for mu_hat (covering P27-P39) to capture the current regime mean of 206.6 units per period, and recent_13 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed during this window (std ~31). This ensures the base stock reflects the current stable but slightly more volatile demand pattern.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~207 units/period over the most recent stabilization phase (P27-P40), with recent demand (P40) being 223 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals (confirmed up to Period 36 order arriving in Period 40). Stock levels are healthy with 113 on hand and a strong pipeline of 752 units. To maintain safety levels and cover the (L+1)=5 period demand window while minimizing holding costs given the $1/unit cost, I will continue using a recent_N approach. I'll use N=14 (P27-P40) to capture the current stable regime's mean and variance, which accounts for the moderate volatility (std ~30) observed in this period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a regime with a mean of approximately 207 units per period since Period 27 (mean P27-P41: 205.9). Recent demand observations (P39: 171, P40: 223, P41: 226) support this, with a slight upward trend in the last two periods. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 141, and there is a significant pipeline of 726 units. To maintain appropriate stock levels without over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (Period 50), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 (covering the period since the last major shift at P27) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the stabilized volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods is well-confirmed by history.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~207 units/period since Period 27. The most recent demand samples are [222, 240, 196, 170, 171, 223, 226, 219], resulting in a recent mean of 208.3 and a standard deviation of 26.5. This confirms the 'Period 39' carry-over insight of stabilization at ~207 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as observed in recent arrivals (P38 order arrived in P42). I will set L to 'default' (4), and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=16 to cover the entire stable regime since Period 27 (42-27+1 = 16). This provides a reliable estimate for the (L+1)=5 period demand window while smoothing out some of the recent volatility. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=16 to ensure the safety stock covers the observed demand variability.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 17 periods (P27-P43) with a mean of 207.2 and a standard deviation of 29.3. Recent performance (last 5 periods, P39-P43) shows a mean of 203.0, suggesting the ~207 level remains a robust forecast. The pipeline inventory is currently high (836 units), but distributed over the lead time periods. All recent orders have arrived with the promised lead time of 4 periods. I am using recent_N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the noise from previous lower regimes. This will ensure the OR backend aims for a service level that covers the ~207 mean demand over the (1+L) horizon.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a regime with a mean of approximately 205 units per period over the last 18 periods (P27-P44 mean = 205.2). Most recent demand (P44) was 208, and the last 5 periods (P40-P44) show a mean of 210.4, indicating consistency with the ~207 baseline established in the Period 39 insight. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of P40's order in P44. I will use recent_N (N=18) to capture the current stable regime's mean and variance for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory plus pipeline (currently 882 units) appropriately covers the lead time plus review period (5 periods of demand) against the ~205-210 unit mean.

The most recent demand samples (P40-P46) are [223, 226, 219, 176, 208, 204, 208], maintaining a consistent average of 209.1 over the last 7 periods. I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime (covering P27 to P46, which is exactly 20 samples). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival data. On-hand inventory is 83, with 795 units in-transit (orders from P43-P46 totaling 795), which is sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5) based on the current demand rate (~200 * 5 = 1000). The target inventory level produced by the OR backend should maintain service levels while managing holding costs as the game approaches its conclusion in Period 50.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since approximately Period 27. The mean demand from Period 27 to Period 47 is 206.5 units per period. In the most recent 10 periods (P38-P47), the mean is 204.2, showing high consistency. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P47 (ordered P43). We are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 48 of 50). With a lead time of 4, orders placed now will not arrive before the simulation ends (P48 order would arrive P52). However, to adhere to the base stock policy and provide parameters that cover the remaining horizon/lead time risk, I will use a 10-period window to capture the current stable demand regime (recent_N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain the service level while managing the 72 units on-hand and 782 units in-transit.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 27, with a mean of approximately 205.8 units per period (based on the last 22 periods). Specifically, the mean demand for the most recent 10 periods (P39-P48) is 208.4, and for the last 5 periods (P44-P48) it is 211.8. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only two periods left (P49 and P50) and a high in-transit quantity (823 units), the primary goal is to ensure demand for the final days is met while minimizing ending inventory. The OR backend's capped policy will naturally moderate the order size based on the significant pipeline. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent stable regime (N=10) to capture the slight uptick in demand (mean ~208) while maintaining standard lead tracking.

Daily Reward (R_t): $882.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues at the stabilized regime established around Period 39. The mean demand from P39 to P49 is approximately 211.6 units per period, with a standard deviation of 19.5, confirming the ~210 baseline. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P45 order in P49. Currently, on-hand inventory is low at 14 units, but significant pipeline inventory exists (837 units). Since this is the final period of the simulation, the priority is to provide parameters that reflect the current distribution to ensure the backend calculates an appropriate final status, although no further orders will arrive after the resolution of this period. I will use recent_N=11 for mu_hat (covering P39-P49) and recent_N=11 for sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable phase variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a higher mean of ~212 units/period from Period 39 to 49 (avg: 211.6, std: 19.5).
