Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Currently in Period 1. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 5 periods shows a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. With a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level q is 0.8. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since there is no on-hand inventory or units in transit, I will use the default methods to establish a baseline order. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for (L+1)=3 periods. There are no observed lead times or demand shifts yet, so default parameters based on the full history are appropriate.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and a demand of 108, resulting in lost sales. An order of 141 units was placed in P1, which is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in P3 given the promised lead time of L=2. The historical demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108] shows a mean of approximately 110.8 and a standard deviation of 15.8. Since we are in the early stages of the simulation (Period 2) and there is no evidence of a demand regime shift or lead-time deviation yet, I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full historical window. L=2 (promised) is used to cover demand during the replenishment cycle (L+1 = 3 periods). The OR backend will calculate the base stock to satisfy the critical ratio q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $229.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we observe that the actual lead time for the first order (placed in P1) was 1 period, despite a promised lead time of 2. Historical demand (pre-game + P1-P2) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74]. The mean of all 7 samples is 105.57. However, demand in P2 (74) was notably lower than previous samples. I will set L to 1 (explicitly, based on the P1 delivery performance) to prevent over-ordering through the OR backend's base-stock calculation. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the full historical context while including the recent P2 dip. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to account for the current volatility. This approach balances the lower recent demand with the higher pre-game averages while adjusting for the observed faster-than-promised delivery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe that we are currently out of stock (ending on-hand inventory is 0 for Period 3). Historical demand for the last 5 samples is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (from pre-game) and [108, 74, 119] (from game history), resulting in a mean demand of approximately 107.25 units per period. The promised lead time is 2, but we observed an actual lead time of 1 period for the order placed in Period 1 (arrived in Period 2). The order placed in Period 2 (137 units) did not arrive in Period 3 (conclude shows arrived=0), which is consistent with the promised lead time of 2. Therefore, we expect 137 units to arrive during Period 4 and 32 units to arrive during Period 5. To ensure we cover demand for the review period plus lead time (L+1), and given the recent stockout, I will use recent_N for demand estimation to capture the current volatility. Since the observed lead time was 1 for the first shipment but the second is following the promised 2, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the OR backend average the observed performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $483.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is low (13 units) following a stockout in Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows moderate volatility around a mean of 109. Lead times have been variable: Period 1 arrived in 1 period, while Period 2 arrived in 2 periods (average 1.5). We are currently in Period 5, expecting the arrival of the Period 3 order (32 units). I will use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the average observed drift and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most recent levels (avg ~112) while filtering out the outlier low of 74 in Period 2. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock level that covers the 1.5-period lead time plus the current period (L+1), ensuring sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 0. Past demand for chips(Regular) has been [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51], which averages 103.3 units. I observe high volatility (standard deviation ~26) and stockouts in Period 3 and Period 5 due to timing. Lead times observed so far are 1 period (P1 order) and 2 periods (P2 order). The orders from P3 (32 units), P4 (74 units), and P5 (138 units) are currently in-transit (Total: 244). According to promised lead time (L=2), the P3 order (32 units) should arrive during Period 6, but since it was small and we are at 0 on-hand, we need a robust base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (avg ~95) and volatility to capture the recent lower-demand period (P5 demand was only 51) while maintaining a buffer for the 100+ spikes. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed lead times (1.5 periods).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the system is facing a stockout with 0 units on-hand. Examining the history, the lead time has been inconsistent: Period 1 order arrived in 1 period, while Period 2 order arrived in 2. Crucially, the order from Period 3 (32 units) and Period 4 (74 units) have not arrived as of the end of Period 6, despite the promised lead time being 2. This suggests either a lead time drift or potential lost shipments. Total demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67] shows a mean of ~100, but recent demand (P5-P6) has dropped. Given the uncertainty in lead time and the current stockout, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delays observed (P3/P4 orders missing). I will use a mu_hat based on the last 6 samples (N=6) to capture the recent downward trend in demand while maintaining enough stock to recover from the stockout. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability: P3 (32 units) and P4 (74 units) orders are overdue as of P7, suggesting actual lead time may exceed 2 periods or shipments are lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 54 units on-hand and 247 units in-transit. Historically, demand over the last 5 periods (P3-P7) has been [119, 124, 51, 67, 103], with a mean of 92.8 units. The lead time has fluctuated: P1 arrived in 1 period, P2 in 2, P5 in 2, and P6 in 1. Crucially, the orders from P3 (32 units) and P4 (74 units) are still missing as of P7's conclusion (which would be 4 and 3 periods late, respectively). Since subsequent orders from P5 and P6 arrived on time, the P3 and P4 shipments are likely lost. I am maintaining L=2 (promised) as the flow for newer orders seems to have stabilized at 1-2 periods. I will use a mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current demand regime (mean ~93). Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a standard buffer. The backend's base-stock logic will subtract the 247 units in-transit (pipeline), but since the OR engine doesn't know some units are likely lost, I am monitoring if a future 'explicit' L or mu_hat adjustment is needed to compensate for the inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of Period 3 (32 units) and Period 4 (74 units) shipments; newer orders (P5, P6) arrived normally, suggesting the supply chain bottleneck was temporary/random rather than a permanent lead-time shift.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory after selling out in Period 8. The demand history shows a relatively stable mean with no clear seasonal trend (average demand over 8 periods is ~92). The promised lead time is 2, though we have seen actual lead times of 1 and 2. Crucially, orders from P3 (32 units) and P4 (74 units) are confirmed lost per Carry-over Insights, which explains why the 'In-transit' count of 262 includes these 'phantom' units (P3: 32 + P4: 74 + P7: 141 + P8: 15 = 262). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (in-transit) to calculate the order size, it will subtract these 106 lost units from the target base stock, leading to under-ordering. To compensate for these 'frozen' units in the pipeline and maintain service levels, I am setting an explicit L=3 (to slightly increase base stock) and using a 'recent_N' of 5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers P4-P8, mean=87.4) and sigma_hat (std=~27). The choice of L=3 helps bridge the gap created by the lost units that the OR backend still believes are coming.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a stable demand pattern with a mean of approximately 97 units over the last 9 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 41 units, with 256 units in transit (likely including orders from Period 8, 9, and 10). Historically, lead times have varied between 1 and 2 periods (P1: 1, P2: 2, P5: 2, P6: 1, P7: 2). Although the carry-over insights mention lost orders from Period 3 and 4, the recent supply chain performance (P5, P6, P7 arrivals) has returned to the promised lead time of 2. Therefore, I will set L to 'default' (2). For demand, the most recent 5 periods (P5-P9) show an average of 82.6, which is lower than the long-term average. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this recent lower demand level and ensure we don't overstock while the pipeline clears. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 10. The system shows 256 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, and P10). Looking at historical data, the promised lead time is 2 periods, and most arrivals confirm a 1 or 2-period actual lead time. The previous carry-over insights correctly identified the loss of P3 and P4 orders, but the supply chain appears to have stabilized since then (P5, P6, P7 arrived within 1-2 periods). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but remains relatively stable around a mean. Demand for the last 5 periods (P6-P10) was [67, 103, 92, 100, 79], averaging ~88.2. I will use a recent window (N=5) to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this slightly lower demand compared to the initial past data, while keeping lead time at the default (2) as recent performance aligns with this expectation. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=3 periods of demand to recover from the current stockout.

In Period 12, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit pipeline of 287 units.

Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P1:1, P2:2, P5:2, P6:1, P7:2), with a notable loss of shipments from P3 and P4. The promised lead time is 2, and current evidence supports staying with this default. Given the recent stockouts (P10, P11), the OR backend needs to maintain a robust base stock. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the slightly higher recent demand intensity (avg ~100) and ensure the pipeline is replenished against this target. Sigma_hat will use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will subtract the 287 units in-transit from the base stock calculation to determine the order for this period.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current state shows 0 units on-hand and 321 units in-transit. Historically, shipments from Period 3 and 4 were lost, but subsequent orders (P5, P6, P7) arrived with lead times of 1 or 2 periods. The promised lead time is 2. Currently, orders from P8, P9, P10, P11, and P12 are outstanding (totaling 215 units, though P8/P9 are overdue and may be lost). Demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has been [92, 100, 79, 122, 119], averaging 102.4 units per period. The pipeline is heavily congested with 321 units, which is roughly 3 periods of demand. I will set L to the promised 2 periods. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level of ~102/period, leading to a base stock targeting (1+2)*102 = 306 units. Since in-transit (321) already exceeds this, the OR backend will likely order 0 or the minimum required by the cap, which is appropriate given the potential for multiple arrivals from the pipeline. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the product chips(Regular) has 0 units on-hand and 334 units in-transit. Historically, demand has averaged 99.4 units per period (last 13 periods). We are currently experiencing a severe stockout since Period 11, with 0 sales for three consecutive periods. Analysis of lead times shows arrivals usually take 1 or 2 periods (P1 arrived P2, P2 arrived P4, P5 arrived P7, P6 arrived P7, P7 arrived P9). However, orders from P8 (15 units), P9 (135 units), P10 (0 units), P11 (31 units), P12 (34 units), and P13 (13 units) have not yet arrived. The order from Period 9 (135 units) is now 5 periods old, which is significantly beyond the promised lead time of 2. Given the previous 'Carry-over Insight' about lost shipments (P3, P4), there is a high risk that the P9 shipment is also lost. To compensate for this probable loss and the current stockout, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods plus a buffer to recover from the stockout. Using a 5-period window (N=5) for demand, the average is 104.8. For L=2, mu_hat = (2+1)*104.8 = 314.4. To account for the likely loss of the 135-unit order in-transit, I am increasing mu_hat to ensure the OR backend places a replenishment order despite the high 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: Period 9 order (135 units) is likely lost (5 periods elapsed, promised 2), contributing to the current 3-period stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 14 periods shows a mean of approximately 100 units per period (sum=1389, n=14). Lead times have been erratic: while the promised lead time is 2, we have observed 1, 2, and 3 periods, along with lost shipments from P3, P4, and P9. Specifically, the P9 order (135 units) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 398 units is misleadingly high by 135 units. Only the P14 order (142 units) and any order placed now can be realistically expected. Given the consistent demand mean (recent 5-period mean is 110, full mean is 99) and the supply instability, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the stable demand around 100/period while L remains at the default (2) to ensure the base stock calculation targets a 3-period window (L+1). This allows the OR backend to aim for a base stock around 300-330 units, accounting for the 142 units truly in transit from P14.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed loss of Period 9 shipment (135 units); pipeline inventory is overinflated by this amount. Demand remains stable around 100 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 398 units. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 3 (32 units), Period 4 (74 units), and Period 9 (135 units) are lost. Subtracting these (241 units) from the visible in-transit (398 units) leaves a true pipeline of 157 units (the Period 14 order of 142 units and the Period 8 order of 15 units, though the P8 order is now 8 periods old and likely also lost). Current demand is stable, averaging 106.6 units over the last 15 periods and 110.8 over the last 5 periods. The backend OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' logic will overcount the lost units as available stock, leading to under-ordering. To compensate, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods (3 periods total) plus a buffer to offset the lost inventory that the backend still 'sees'. Total demand for 3 periods is ~333 units. Since the backend thinks I have 398 units in-transit when I only effectively have 142, I need to inflate the mu_hat to trigger an order. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time (approx 2 periods), mu_hat to an explicit value of 450 to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the ghost pipeline, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Cumulative confirmed lost inventory totals 241 units (P3: 32, P4: 74, P9: 135); P8 order (15 units) is also likely lost (8 periods overdue). Effective pipeline is only 142 units despite 398 units showing as in-transit.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 464 units in-transit. However, based on the carry-over insights and historical gaps, a significant portion of the in-transit inventory is confirmed lost or extremely overdue: Period 3 (32), Period 4 (74), Period 8 (15), and Period 9 (135). The total confirmed lost units are 256. This means the effective pipeline is actually 208 units (464 - 256), consisting of the Period 14 (142) and Period 16 (66) orders. Demand in the most recent periods (P14-P16) has averaged 136.7, while the longer-term average (last 5 periods) is 126.2. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent slight increase in demand while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat is set to default as demand volatility remains within normal bounds for this category. L is set to 'default' (2) because, despite the lost shipments, the orders that do arrive (P11, P12, P13) follow a lead time of 1-3 periods, averaging near the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative confirmed lost inventory updated to 256 units (added P8: 15 units to previous total of 241). Actual available pipeline is significantly lower than system 'In-transit' figure.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, the product 'chips(Regular)' is facing a persistent stockout with 0 units on hand. The recent demand has surged (170 and 213 in the last two periods), significantly exceeding the historical mean of ~100. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this higher demand regime. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' total of 322 units is misleading due to confirmed lost shipments: P3 (32), P4 (74), P8 (15), and P9 (135), totaling 256 lost units. The actual effective pipeline is only 66 units (from P16). To compensate for the lost inventory and ensure the OR backend places an order that bridges the gap, I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 5. This artificially increases the target base stock, offsetting the 256 'phantom' units in the pipeline calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). This strategy aims to replenish on-hand inventory to meet the newly elevated demand levels while accounting for the unreliable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased from ~100 to ~190 (+90%) over the last two periods. Total confirmed lost inventory now includes Period 8 (15 units), bringing the total loss to 256 units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. The average demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) is approximately 183 units (170, 213, 166), compared to the previous long-term average of approximately 100. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new level. The system shows an 'In-transit' of 543 units, but my records indicate substantial losses: P3 (32), P4 (74), P9 (135), and P8 (15), totaling 256 lost units. Additionally, P16 (66) and P18 (221) are the only valid orders currently in the pipeline (totaling 287 valid units). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I will use an 'explicit' L of 5. By setting L=5, the base stock calculation becomes (1+5)*183, which helps compensate for the ~256 units of 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive, ensuring the order placed today is sufficient to meet the new demand level despite the pipeline inventory error.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: mean increased from ~100 to ~183 (+83%). Total cumulative confirmed lost inventory is 256 units (P3, P4, P8, P9).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward regime shift starting at Period 16. In the last four periods (16-19), demand has been [170, 213, 166, 231], averaging 195 units, compared to the previous average of ~100 units. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this new mean. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for increased volatility. Lead time remains volatile but generally aligns with the promised 2 periods (recent arrivals: P14 arrived in 3, P18 arrived in 1). I will stick to 'default' for L. Critically, there is a cumulative loss of 256 units (P3, P4, P8, P9) still reflected in the 'In-transit' figure of 548. The actual pipeline is roughly 292 units (orders from P16 and P19). By setting a high mu_hat based on the new demand level, I expect the OR backend to place an order that compensates for the lost units while targeting the new demand mean, ensuring we reach the required base stock despite the phantom inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: avg increased from ~100 to 195 (+95%). Cumulative lost inventory (P3, P4, P8, P9) totals 256 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from a mean of ~100 to an average of 195.6 over the last 5 periods ([170, 213, 166, 231, 198]). To address this, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volume and volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system shows 632 units in-transit. However, cumulative confirmed lost shipments (P3, P4, P8, P9) total 256 units. Additionally, the P16 order (66 units) is now 2 periods overdue (ordered P16, today is P21), making it highly suspect given the promised lead time of 2. Subtracting 256 (confirmed) + 66 (likely lost) = 322 units from the 632 in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 310 units (P18, P19, P20 orders). Since the OR backend is unaware of these losses and will see a massive (but fake) pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value to force an order that bridges the gap. I calculate the required base stock for (L+1)=3 periods at the new mean: 3 * 195.6 = 586.8. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 632 units in-transit, I set mu_hat to 1218 (Effective Pipeline 310 + Desired Base Stock 586 + Buffer for stockouts). This compensates for the 322 ghost units in the system's pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed total lost inventory increased to 322 units (P3: 32, P4: 74, P8: 15, P9: 135, and P16: 66). Demand regime shift at P16 remains stable at ~195 units/period.

The supply chain is unreliable, with a total of 322 units confirmed as lost (P3: 32, P4: 74, P8: 15, P9: 135, P16: 66). Current In-transit is 1084 units, but the effective pipeline is only 762 units (1084 - 322). Lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, so I am using the promised L=2 for the backend while adjusting mu_hat to cover the actual observed demand level and volatility. I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat (Periods 16-21) to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~195). Given the frequent stockouts and lost shipments, I am setting an explicit sigma_hat to increase the safety stock buffer and protect against the high variability in both demand and supply arrival.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Confirmed total lost inventory remains at 322 units. Demand regime since P16 is sustained at ~195 units/period (last 6 periods). Supply reliability is low, necessitating higher explicit volatility parameters.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we are navigating a sustained demand regime shift that began in Period 16. The average demand over the last 7 periods is approximately 192 units/period, compared to the previous baseline of ~100. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: cumulative confirmed lost inventory has reached 322 units (P3: 32, P4: 74, P8: 15, P9: 135, P16: 66). The current 'In-transit' figure of 774 is misleading because it includes these 322 units that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is actually 452 units (primarily from the large P21 order). I am setting L to 2 (promised), as recent arrivals (P19 at 3 periods, P20 at 2 periods) suggest the lead time is fluctuating around the promised value rather than shifting permanently. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=7) to capture the high-demand regime since Period 16. For sigma_hat, I am using an explicit value of 100 to account for both demand volatility and the high risk of shipment loss, signaling the OR backend to maintain a higher buffer to avoid the frequent stockouts seen in recent history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: avg demand sustained at ~192 units/period (last 7 periods). Total confirmed lost inventory remains 322 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the inventory position for chips(Regular) is stable with 343 units on-hand. The demand regime shift identified at Period 16 remains sustained, with demand over the last 8 periods (P16-P23) averaging 198.75 units (170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176, 243). I will use N=8 to capture this specific regime. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is currently 322 units, which exactly matches the total confirmed lost inventory (P3: 32, P4: 74, P8: 15, P9: 135, P16: 66). This means the effective pipeline is zero. Since on-hand inventory (343) is sufficient to cover approximately 1.7 periods of demand and the promised lead time is 2, I need to ensure the OR engine recognizes the current demand level. Setting L to the promised 2 periods and mu_hat using the recent N=8 samples will set a base stock that accounts for the higher demand. Given the history of lost shipments and high demand variance (std dev ~27 in this regime), I am using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to ensure the service level is maintained against potential stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 is sustained: avg 199 units/period (last 8 periods). Cumulative lost inventory (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16) accounts for 100% of the current 322 units reported as In-transit, meaning effective pipeline is 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $632.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~100 to ~198 units/period. Over the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the mean demand is 198.3, and the standard deviation is approximately 25.8. As noted in the carry-over insights, the current 'In-transit' figure of 322 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0. With an on-hand inventory of 148 units and a lead time of 2 periods, we must cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). Expected demand over 3 periods is 594 units. Since the OR backend uses a capped policy [min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)], and it perceives a pipeline of 322 units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target stock level to account for the phantom inventory. To achieve a target of ~600 units while the backend subtracts 322, mu_hat needs to be set such that (mu_hat - 322) results in the desired order. However, since mu_hat is defined as (1+L) * mean, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the 3-period demand (594) plus the lost units (322) to ensure the backend places an order that covers future demand despite the 'In-transit' error. I'll use recent_N=9 for sigma to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 is sustained: avg 198 units/period (last 9 periods). Effective pipeline is confirmed 0; 'In-transit' 322 is entirely comprised of lost units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand analysis: Since Period 16, a significant regime shift has occurred with demand increasing from ~100 to ~197 units/period (mean of last 10 samples: 197.0). Period 25 ending inventory is 0, indicating a stockout. Supply chain analysis: The 'In-transit' figure of 672 units is deceptive. According to the Carry-over Insights, 322 units (orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16) are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline consists only of the order placed in P25 (350 units). To maintain service levels in the new high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the ~197 avg. Since lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, and multiple shipments have been lost, I will use an explicit lead time of 2 (promised) but set sigma_hat explicitly high to account for the supply instability and the recent demand surge. The OR backend will calculate base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, where z for q=0.8 is approx 0.84.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 is sustained: avg 197 units/period (last 10 periods). Effective pipeline is confirmed to exclude 322 lost units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16); current true pipeline is 350 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~194 units per period (last 11 periods avg: 194.3). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 672 units is misleading because 322 units are confirmed lost (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). The actual effective pipeline consists of the Period 25 order (350 units), which is expected to arrive during Period 27 or 28 based on the lead time history. To ensure the OR backend accounts for the higher demand regime and doesn't under-order due to the phantom 'In-transit' stock, I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' will include the 322 lost units, I must counteract this by using an 'explicit' L that is higher than the promised 2 periods or by adjusting mu_hat. Given the OR engine formula: final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap), and pipeline_inventory is 672 (350 real + 322 fake), I need base_stock to be high enough to trigger an order. I will set L to 4 (explicit) to reflect the combined effect of lead time variability and to 'absorb' the inventory gap caused by lost units in the base stock calculation.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for chips(Regular) is in a high-regime state that began at Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 194 units/period (last 12 periods: mean=194.2, std=23.3). Lead times are highly unstable, frequently shifting between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a robust L setting. The reported 'In-transit' of 909 units is misleading due to cumulative lost shipments (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16) totaling 322 units. Subtracting these, the effective pipeline is 587 units (P25: 350, P27: 237). At Period 28, we are out of stock. The P25 order (350 units) is expected to arrive during Period 28 (L=3), which will resolve the stockout. I am setting L=3 to reflect the observed upper bound of lead time instability. Mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=12) to capture the current demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to allow the OR backend to calculate volatility across the full history, providing a safer buffer against the high variance and stockout risks observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed total lost inventory is 322 units (P3: 32, P4: 74, P8: 15, P9: 135, P16: 66). Demand regime starting Period 16 is sustained at ~194 units/period (last 12 periods). Lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $478.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29, the demand regime that started at Period 16 remains stable, with an average of approximately 195 units per period (last 13 samples). The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 374 units following the arrival of orders from P25 and P27. The system reports 322 units 'In-transit', but historical tracking confirms these are all lost shipments (P3, P4, P8, P9, and P16). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. To ensure the OR backend places a correct order despite this 'phantom' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Since L is volatile (ranging from 1 to 3), I will assume L=2 for planning. The target base stock should cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand. Target = 195 * 3 = 585 units. However, because the backend subtracts the pipeline (322) from the base stock, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat + z*sigma_hat - 322' equals the desired order quantity. To replenish inventory and account for the 374 on-hand, the OR engine needs to see a requirement for roughly 211 units (585 target - 374 on-hand). To force this, I set mu_hat to 900 (calculated as roughly 585 target + 322 phantom pipeline) and sigma_hat to 100 to maintain a high service level given lead-time volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the demand regime shift that began in Period 16 is well-established, with demand averaging approximately 197 units over the last 14 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 159 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 611 units contains 322 confirmed lost units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), leaving an effective pipeline of 289 units (the order placed in Period 29). Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (base_stock - pipeline), the presence of these 322 ghost units will cause the system to severely under-order or not order at all. To correct for this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the (L+1) demand coverage (approx 3 * 197 = 591) PLUS the 322 units of lost inventory that the backend incorrectly subtracts. This total (591 + 322 = 913) ensures the OR engine places an order to maintain the necessary stock levels despite the overinflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=14) to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, increasing from ~100 to ~200 units per period. The average demand over the last 15 periods (P16-P30) is 198.7 units. Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a promised lead time of 2. In-transit inventory is currently 788 units, but 322 of those units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16) are confirmed lost based on historical carry-over insights. Thus, the effective pipeline is 466 units (788 - 322). The ending on-hand inventory is 0. To ensure the backend places a sufficient order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units = (1+2)*200 + 322 = 922. This 'tricks' the backend into recognizing that the 322 units in the pipeline are non-existent, ensuring the target base stock (approx 600 units for 3 periods of demand) is met by ordering the difference between the target and the actual 466-unit effective pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=15 to capture the increased volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns; confirmed lost inventory remains at 322 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16); demand regime remains stable at ~200 units/period since Period 16.

The most recent demand (P31: 276) suggests a possible upward trend or high volatility. Lead times remain unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, though the promised lead time is 2. A critical factor is the 'In-transit' inventory of 666 units: based on historical evidence (Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, 16), 322 units are confirmed lost. Subtracting these from the current 666 units leaves an effective pipeline of 344 units (comprised of orders from P30 and P31). With on-hand inventory at 13 units, the total effective inventory is 357 units. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the current high-demand regime (Period 16 onwards) while using 'explicit' for L to account for the lead time variability. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to reflect the higher volatility observed in the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 is sustained: avg ~201 units/period (last 16 periods). Cumulative lost inventory remains at 322 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), which persistently inflates the system's 'In-transit' figure.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 33 context: Demand regime since Period 16 is stable at an average of ~205 units/period (last 17 periods), significantly higher than the initial ~100. Effective pipeline analysis: System reports 489 units in-transit, but cumulative confirmed lost shipments (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16) total 322 units. Thus, the actual effective pipeline is 167 units (ordered in P31), which is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of the current Period 33. With only 4 units on-hand, we are relying on this P31 arrival to meet current demand. To maintain the base stock level (target: (L+1) * demand) under the current regime, I set L=2, mu_hat based on the last 17 samples (N=17), and sigma_hat also based on recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets approximately 615 units (3 * 205) of total inventory, correctly accounting for the 322 'ghost' units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns; confirmed lost inventory remains at 322 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16); demand regime since P16 remains stable at ~205 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 16 remains stable at an average of approximately 201 units per period (last 18 samples). The 'In-transit' figure of 652 units is significantly inflated by 322 units of confirmed lost inventory (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Subtracting these lost units, the 'effective' pipeline is 330 units (comprised of orders from P31 and P33). Lead times have been volatile, averaging around 2 periods but frequently extending to 3. To maintain a high service level given the supply instability and the stockout in Period 33, I am setting mu_hat using the last 18 samples to capture the high-demand regime and keeping L at the promised 2 periods. The OR engine's base-stock calculation will account for the lead time and the current (inflated) pipeline, but our mu_hat selection ensures we target the higher volume seen recently.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level of approximately 201 units/period since Period 16 (19 observations). Recent demand in Period 34 was 171, following 182 in Period 33. The 'In-transit' figure of 485 is significantly inflated by 322 units confirmed lost (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), leaving an effective pipeline of only 163 units (ordered in Period 33). Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. To ensure adequate stock despite the lost inventory distortion and demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using the recent 19-period average (post-regime shift) and increasing L to 3 to reflect the maximum observed lead time recently, which also helps the OR engine compensate for the lost units by targeting a higher base stock. Sigma_hat is set to default based on the recent regime volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 is sustained: avg ~201 units/period (last 19 periods). Cumulative lost inventory remains at 322 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), which persistently inflates the system's 'In-transit' figure, making effective pipeline inventory 'In-transit - 322'.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 201 units per period. In the most recent period (P35), demand was 222. The inventory situation is complicated by 322 units of confirmed lost shipments (Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, 16) which remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 733. The true effective pipeline is 411 units (733 - 322). Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with recent arrivals (P29, P30, P31) averaging a lead time of 2.33 periods. To account for the lost inventory and ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the (L+1) horizon at the current demand level (~200 units/period), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable high-demand regime. For sigma_hat, I am using a recent window (N=10) to reflect the increased volatility seen in this high-demand phase. By setting L to 3 (explicitly), I signal to the backend that the replenishment cycle is longer due to both actual lead time drift and the need to 'bypass' the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline until the capped policy levels it out.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 201 units per period. In Period 37, we start with 0 on-hand inventory. The system reports 862 units in-transit, but as documented in the carry-over insights, 322 of these units are confirmed lost (from orders in Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, and 16). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 540 units (862 - 322). These 540 units consist of orders from Period 33 (163 units), Period 35 (248 units), and Period 36 (129 units). Given the lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, we expect arrivals soon to address the current stockout. I am setting L to the default (promised 2 periods) as there is no evidence of a permanent shift to a longer lead time, only high variance. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=21 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime since Period 16. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=21 to account for the increased volatility in this higher-demand period, which helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient safety stock level given the frequent stockouts observed.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38, demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime that started around Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 201 units per period. The supply chain remains unreliable, with a total of 322 units confirmed lost (Periods 3, 4, 8, 9, 16). The 'In-transit' figure of 862 units is significantly inflated by these 322 ghost units, meaning the true pipeline is only 540 units (Orders from P33, P35, P36). The Promised Lead Time (L) is 2, but actual arrivals fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. To compensate for the lost inventory that the OR engine incorrectly counts as 'on its way,' I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for L=2 (which covers 3 periods of demand) as: (3 periods * 201 units/period) + (lost inventory adjustment of 322 units) = 925 units. By setting mu_hat to 925, I ensure the OR engine (which subtracts the full 862 in-transit from the base stock) still places an order to replenish the physical stock needed to meet current demand levels. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for recent high demand volatility and lead-time inconsistency.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stable at an average of approximately 203 units per period (last 23 periods). The current In-transit inventory of 993 units includes 322 units confirmed as lost (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), making the true pipeline 671 units. Observed lead times recently range from 1 to 3 periods, averaging 2.1 periods. With On-hand inventory at 0 and a current true pipeline of 671, the OR engine needs to cover roughly (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 600-610 units). Since true pipeline (671) > expected 3-period demand (609), the policy will likely minimize new ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=23 to capture the post-Period 16 demand shift while setting L to 'calculate' to account for lead time volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $595.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stable with an average of approximately 201 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 89 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 733 units includes 322 units confirmed as lost (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16), making the true pipeline 411 units. Observed lead times recently have been 3, 1, 3, and 2 periods, making the average L=2.25. However, since the OR engine uses the promised L=2 by default, I will use 'calculate' to capture the slightly longer actual lead time. For mu_hat, I use recent_N=24 to capture the stable demand regime since Period 16 (40 - 16 = 24). For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=24 to ensure volatility is calculated based on the current higher-demand regime, ensuring a sufficient safety stock to handle lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed total lost inventory remains at 322 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16); demand regime since P16 is stable at ~201 units/period (last 24 periods). True pipeline calculation must subtract 322 from the 'In-transit' value.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 41. Demand Context: The demand regime since Period 16 is stable, averaging approximately 201 units per period. Most recent demand (P40) was 223 units. Supply Context: On-hand inventory is 0. 'In-transit' is reported as 733 units. Based on historical data (Carry-over Insights), 322 units (orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, P16) are confirmed lost. Therefore, the true pipeline inventory is 733 - 322 = 411 units. These 411 units consist of orders from Period 33 (163 units) and Period 35 (248 units). Both are overdue (lead times of 8 and 6 periods respectively vs. promised 2), indicating a significant supply chain delay or further potential losses. However, since they haven't been confirmed lost yet, I will treat them as delayed pipeline. Parameters: I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=25 (covering the regime since P16) to capture the higher demand level. I am using explicit sigma_hat set to 50 to account for both demand volatility and the high risk of stockouts caused by lead-time uncertainty. Lead time L is set to explicit 2 (promised) because the OR backend uses this for the base stock calculation, and I've manually adjusted for losses in my logic regarding the pipeline.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 16 remains stable at an average of approximately 201 units per period. Recent demands (P39-P41: 171, 223, 226) support this. The primary challenge is the supply chain: the system shows an In-transit balance of 733 units, but my tracking confirms that 322 of these are long-lost shipments (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16). Furthermore, orders from P33 (163 units) and P35 (248 units) are now 9 and 7 periods old respectively; given the promised lead time of 2 and observed maximum of 3, these are also likely lost or severely delayed. If P33 and P35 are lost, the effective pipeline is only 122 units (the P40/P41 zero orders are placeholders, but actually there are no recent large orders arriving). However, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will be heavily suppressed by the 733 units it 'thinks' are coming. To force the backend to place an order that covers the current stockout and the (L+1) demand window, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for (2+1) periods as 3 * 201 = 603. To counteract the 733 in-transit units and ensure an order is placed, I set mu_hat to 1350 (603 + 747 to offset the ghost inventory). I set sigma_hat to a high explicit value to account for the extreme lead-time volatility and frequent lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed total lost inventory increased to 733 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16, plus P33: 163 and P35: 248), as these orders are significantly past the observed 3-period max lead time. Demand remains stable at ~201 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 201 units per period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1251 is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments. Per the Carry-over Insights, 733 units are confirmed lost (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16, P33, P35). This leaves an effective pipeline of 518 units (the order placed in Period 42). To bridge the gap created by these losses and the persistent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Given the average demand of ~201, mu_hat is set to 603. I am using a higher explicit sigma_hat of 120 to account for the high lead-time volatility (1-3 periods) and the frequent loss of shipments, which ensures the OR backend targets a higher base stock to improve the service level despite the unreliable supply chain.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the inventory situation is critical. On-hand inventory is 0, and while 'In-transit' shows 1251 units, our carry-over analysis confirms that at least 733 units are lost (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16, P33, P35). This leaves an effective pipeline of 518 units (the order from P42). Since the promised lead time is 2, the P42 order is expected to arrive during P44 or P45. Demand has been stable in a high-regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 201 units/period. The current stockout (starting P40) and high loss rate necessitate maintaining a high service level. I am setting L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to 603 (based on 201 * (2+1)), and sigma_hat to 60 (explicitly elevated to account for supply chain volatility/losses and the recent high-demand variance).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Supply chain remains highly unreliable; cumulative confirmed lost inventory is 733 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16, P33, P35). Effective pipeline is 'In-transit minus 733'. Demand regime remains stable at ~201 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 16, averaging approximately 201 units per period. However, the supply chain is extremely unreliable. As of Period 44, I have confirmed that 733 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are lost (Orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, P16, P33, and P35). This means that out of the reported 1251 units 'In-transit', the effective pipeline is actually only 518 units (the order placed in Period 42). Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and the current effective pipeline (518) must cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods), we are facing a significant deficit (3 periods * 201 = 603 units needed). To correct for the 733 'phantom' units that the OR engine thinks are coming but aren't, I will use an 'explicit' L of 5. This artificially extends the look-ahead window, forcing the base-stock calculation higher to trigger a replenishment order that ignores the lost units. I am setting mu_hat based on the recent stable demand (N=24) and keeping sigma_hat reflective of recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Supply chain remains highly unreliable; cumulative confirmed lost inventory is 733 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16, P33, P35). Effective pipeline is 'In-transit minus 733'. Demand regime remains stable at ~201 units/period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are facing a critical inventory situation with 0 on-hand units and a heavily inflated 'In-transit' figure. The Carry-over Insights indicate that 733 units in the pipeline (orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, P16, P33, and P35) are confirmed lost or effectively defunct. The current 'In-transit' of 1283 units minus 733 lost units leaves a true pipeline of 550 units (specifically, the orders from P42 for 518 units and P45 for 32 units). Demand has been stable since Period 16, averaging approximately 201 units per period. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders: final_order = base_stock - In_transit. Because the system is unaware of the 733 lost units, it will under-order unless we artificially increase the base_stock (via mu_hat) to compensate. To maintain a target inventory that covers (L+1) periods of demand while offsetting the 733-unit phantom pipeline, I will set an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Target base_stock for (3+1) periods = 201 * 4 = 804. Adjustment for lost units = 733. Adjusted mu_hat = 804 + 733 = 1537. I set L to 3 to reflect the high end of observed lead times and use a high sigma_hat to account for supply volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a demand regime that has remained stable at ~201 units/period since Period 16. The primary challenge is supply chain unreliability and lost shipments. As identified in the Carry-over Insights, a total of 733 units (orders from P3, P4, P8, P9, P16, P33, and P35) are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' figure is 1632 units. Subtracting the 733 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 899 units (comprising orders from P42, P46, and any other recent non-concluded orders). Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to cover the (L+1) horizon, I am using 'explicit' L=3 to account for the upper end of the observed lead time. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=31 to capture the stable demand regime since the P16 shift. sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' 100 to provide a higher safety buffer given the frequent delivery failures and lost shipments.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the system reports an In-transit inventory of 1632 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 733 units are confirmed lost (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16, P33, P35). This leaves an effective pipeline of 899 units (1632 - 733). The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at approximately 201 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time of 2 (L+1 = 3), the required base stock is approximately 603 units (3 * 201). Since the effective pipeline of 899 units already exceeds the required base stock, the OR backend (even with a cap) would likely order 0 or very little. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable, as evidenced by recent stockouts and missing large orders (like the 518 units from P42 which are now 6 periods late). To ensure the OR backend aims for a higher inventory target to buffer against these losses, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 800 (representing roughly 4 periods of demand at 200/unit) and L to 3 to reflect the actual observed max lead time. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 100 to account for high demand and supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: The 518 units ordered in Period 42 are now 6 periods overdue (promised 2) and are likely lost, potentially increasing total confirmed lost inventory from 733 to 1251 units. Effective pipeline remains critically low despite high system 'In-transit' numbers.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Context: We are in Period 49. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 16 has been stable at approximately 201 units/period. The primary challenge is extreme supply chain unreliability. Cumulative confirmed lost inventory (orders significantly past lead time) has reached 1251 units (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16, P33, P35, and now P42). 

Inventory Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 1632 units 'In-transit'. However, after subtracting the 1251 lost units, the 'Effective Pipeline' is only 381 units (the order from P46). 

Strategy: To address the inflated in-transit figure, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I use 'recent_N' with N=33 (covering the stable regime since P16). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the high system in-transit number, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the lost shipments. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand (~201 * 3 = 603 units) plus a safety buffer. However, because the backend subtracts 'In-transit' (1632) from the base_stock, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that offsets this: Adjusted mu_hat \u2248 Target Base Stock + Lost Inventory = 603 + 1251 = 1854. This ensures the backend recognizes the need for stock despite the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Total confirmed lost inventory increased to 1251 units (P3: 32, P4: 74, P8: 15, P9: 135, P16: 66, P33: 163, P35: 248, P42: 518). Effective pipeline is 'In-transit minus 1251'. Demand remains stable at ~201 units/period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable in the regime that began at Period 16, with an average of approximately 201 units/period. The supply chain is highly unreliable, with a total of 1251 units confirmed lost (P3, P4, P8, P9, P16, P33, P35, P42). While the system reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 1511 units, the effective pipeline is only 260 units (the order from P49). On-hand inventory is 157 units. The OR backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will be severely misled by the 1511 in-transit figure if not corrected. To ensure the backend places a sufficient order to cover the (L+1) period demand (~603 units) plus a safety buffer, I am using the 'explicit' method for L to account for the frequent 3-period lead times and 'explicit' for mu_hat. Specifically, setting mu_hat to 1251 units (estimated demand for L+1 plus the volume of lost orders) will 'trick' the backend into ignoring the lost units in the pipeline, effectively calculating: (1251 + safety) - 1511. However, since the capped policy limits orders, I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=34, covering the stable regime since P16) and rely on the fact that my previous explicit interventions have stabilized the inventory somewhat. Given the current on-hand (157) and true pipeline (260), we have 417 units against a target of roughly 600-800. I will set L=3 to reflect the common actual lead time and mu_hat to a value that forces an order despite the phantom 1251 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Supply chain remains extremely unstable; cumulative lost inventory is 1251 units. System 'In-transit' is 1511, but effective pipeline is only 260 units. Demand regime since P16 is stable at ~201 units/period.
