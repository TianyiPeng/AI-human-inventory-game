Initial demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] suggest an average demand of approximately 111.4 units/period with moderate variance. No specific calendar dates are provided for Period 1, so I will rely on the historical mean. Step 2: Lead Time & Pipeline. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 arrives in P3. My decision must cover demand for P1, P2, and P3 (L+1 + current = 3 periods). Step 3: Inventory Position. On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. Total pipeline is 0. Step 4: Demand Forecast. Forecast for P1-P3 is ~335 units (112 * 3). Step 5: Order Logic. To cover the lead time gap and build a small safety stock (given $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will order enough to satisfy the first three periods plus a buffer. Ordering 360 units ensures I meet the initial demand waves once shipments arrive in P3, acknowledging that P1 and P2 will likely result in stockouts since on-hand is currently 0.",

Subtracting these from the total in-transit (1179 - 958) gives an effective pipeline of 221 units (from Periods 41 and 42). Thus, total effective inventory (on-hand 204 + effective pipeline 221) is 425 units. To cover a target inventory of approximately 3-4 periods of demand (600-800 units) given the high variability in lead time and the risk of lost shipments, I need to place a moderate order to maintain the pipeline. I will order 200 units to reach a total effective position of 625 units, which provides a safety buffer against the ~12% loss rate seen historically while minimizing excessive holding costs.",
