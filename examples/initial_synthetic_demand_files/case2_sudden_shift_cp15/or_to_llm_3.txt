======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data (e.g., Period 1, Period 48) confirms that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (actual lead time = 0). Since Period 49 is the penultimate period, the goal is to satisfy demand for Period 49 and 50 while minimizing ending inventory at the end of the game (Period 50). Current on-hand inventory is 24 units. A major demand regime shift occurred around Period 16, with demand increasing from ~100 to ~200 units. Since Period 30, the average demand has stabilized at ~200-210 units. Recent demands (P41-P48) have been: 226, 219, 176, 208, 204, 208, 231, 208. The average over these 8 periods is approximately 210 units. The OR recommendation of 189 is slightly conservative given this sustained demand level and the starting inventory of 24. To cover expected demand of ~210 with 24 units on hand, an order of 186 units would reach a total availability of 210. However, to avoid a stockout in case of a slight spike (which occurred in P47 at 231), I will order 210 units. This ensures a high service level for P49. In P50, a final adjustment will be made to clear the machine.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 (e.g., Period 49 order arrived in Period 49). Starting on-hand inventory for Period 50 is 10 units. Since Period 16, demand has undergone a significant regime shift, doubling from a baseline of ~100 to an average of ~201 units. Over the last 10 periods (P40-P49), the average demand is approximately 212 units, showing sustained high volume. The OR recommendation of 204 units is based on historical averages including the lower pre-shift data. To adequately meet the current demand regime (averaging ~210-220 recently) while accounting for the 10 units on hand, an order of 215 units is optimal. This targets a total availability of 225 units, which covers the upper end of recent demand observations and minimizes stockout risk for the final period.",
