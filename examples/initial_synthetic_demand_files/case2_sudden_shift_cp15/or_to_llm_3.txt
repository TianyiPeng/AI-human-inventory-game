  "rationale": "In Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit for 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the historical demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the mean demand is 111.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover demand during the lead time and the current period (L+1 = 3 periods), we need to reach a base-stock level. Using a critical fractile of 0.8 (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), the safety factor z is approximately 0.84. The calculated base stock is (3 * 111.4) + (0.84 * sqrt(3) * 17.6) \u2248 334.2 + 25.6 = 359.8 units. The OR algorithm recommends 141 units, which appears to be significantly capped. While the cap formula (mean + 1.645 * std_dev) for a single period is approximately 111.4 + (1.645 * 17.6) = 140.4 (rounding to 141), this quantity is insufficient to cover the total lead-time pipeline from a zero-start. To avoid a massive stockout in Periods 1, 2, and 3, I will override the OR recommendation.

Historical demand across six samples (including Period 1's demand of 108) averages approximately 111 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods.

Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit is 360. The OR baseline recommends 0 units, likely because the current pipeline (360) already covers more than 3 periods of average demand (111 * 3 = 333). Given a critical fractile of 0.8 (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), the target stock for a 3-period window (L+1) would be roughly 333 plus a safety stock buffer.

In-transit consists of 60 units (ordered P3, expected P4 if LT=1, but didn't arrive; now expected P5 if LT=2) and 123 units (ordered P4, expected P5 or P6). Total pipeline is 183 units.

Using a 1-period lead time logic, we need to cover demand for the current period (P5) and the next (P6). Expected demand for 2 periods is ~220. My current inventory position (226) almost exactly covers this.

Excluding lost units, the reliable pipeline is 300 units (from P8, P9, P10). The P8 order should arrive this period (P11), becoming visible in P12. 3.

However, several orders are confirmed lost: P3 (60), P4 (123), P8 (100), and P9 (100), totaling 383 lost units. Current in-transit is 653. Subtracting the 383 lost units leaves a 'real' pipeline of 270 units (P16: 120, P17: 150). 2. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has spiked significantly: P16 (170) and P17 (213), compared to a historical mean of ~100. This suggests a new demand regime or seasonal peak. 3. Inventory & OR Evaluation: On-hand inventory is 0. The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically driven by the inflated 'in-transit' figure (653) which includes lost shipments. OR expects these units to arrive, but they won't. 4. Decision: I must override OR. To cover Period 18, 19, and 20 (L+1 periods), and assuming the new demand mean is ~200, I need a target inventory of ~600. Current real pipeline is 270. Therefore, I need to order approximately 330 units. However, to stay within a reasonable cap and manage holding risk if demand reverts, I will order 300 units to aggressively refill the pipeline.",

Effectively, the reliable pipeline is 803 - 383 = 420 units (specifically from P16: 120, P18: 300). 2. Demand Analysis: Demand has undergone a regime shift.
